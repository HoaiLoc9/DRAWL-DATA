It’s a hell of a time to be alive. Humanity has colonized thousands of star systems spanning a vast region of space known as the Inner Sphere. The golden age of cooperation and advancement is now a distant memory, and humanity has once again splintered into disparate factions all vying for supremacy. In the midst of these Succession Wars, power hungry Mercenaries like yourself are in a privileged position to capitalize big time. It’s dangerous work but that’s why you’re here, right? If you’ve got an itch to blast, wreck, stomp and go all out ballistic, step inside and become your own weapon of war! STORY As the inheritor of a once-prominent Mercenary company, reborn in the flames of its near destruction at the hands of conspiring factions, your quest for glory and revenge will stretch light-years as you chase threads of interstellar intrigue along your journey to becoming an elite MechWarrior and mercenary commander. THE INNER SPHERE Home to thousands of star systems and an array of stunning biomes, the Inner Sphere is alive with activity, purpose, consequence, and variety. Systems will be captured and reclaimed, major events will unfold, and new technologies will come to light. The rigors of war will be seen with each passing week as your relationships with the various factions fluctuate according to the relentless Succession Wars and your choices as the leader of a Mercenary outfit. GAMEPLAY The battlefields of the future are dominated by BattleMechs, hulking machines of war capable of leveling entire cities. As a BattleMech pilot you’ll rain havoc upon enemy ‘Mechs and targets, including tanks, ground vehicles, aircraft, advanced defenses, and reinforced bases. Few things can withstand the power of a ‘Mech for long, and the worlds of the Inner Sphere are veritable playgrounds of destruction awaiting your shielding defense or crushing devastation. BATTLEMECHS \"With over 50 unique ‘Mech chassis and hundreds of sub-variants, all fully-realized with high-fidelity models, damage states, and equipment, no two ‘Mechs are the same! Whether acquired from scouring the markets of the Inner Sphere for rare and valuable chassis and equipment, or salvaging directly from the wreckage of your annihilated enemies and the spoils of war, the maintenance and operation of your BattleMechs will be vital to your success both as a MechWarrior and a Mercenary outfit commander.\" THE MERC LIFE Off the battlefield, as the leader of a Mercenary company you will need to manage all the key components of running a unit. You’ll need to maintain and acquire ‘Mechs and equipment, hire and field MechWarriors from throughout the Inner Sphere to join you on the battlefield, and manage your relationships with the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere, all of whom are vying for your contribution to their staggering war efforts. Of course, with each Contract comes negotiation, and with each victory comes consequence. OTHER FEATURES With the vast scope of the Inner Sphere and its complex system of world generation providing huge variety and replayability, the MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries experience offers no end. Outside the campaign, a fully-featured Instant Action system will allow you to customize and kick off isolated missions at any time, free from campaign restrictions.

As a GATE employee you extend the bounds of human knowledge, and seek to explain the unexplainable - including anomalies and paranormal entities: from gravity-distorting artifacts to supernatural creatures with an unbridled instinct for violence. Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually. After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect - known as The Order - is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos. Containment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way. Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home - for now. Up to 6 players can choose their PHDs, build their scientist, gear up, and explore a massive subterranean complex, filled with supernatural artifacts, transdimensional foes, and science experiments gone awry. Between alien threats hunting their next meal, trigger happy soldiers, and the world’s most advanced robotic security forces attacking personnel working overtime, there’s no shortage of danger. As a scientist, fighting isn’t your forte, so you’ll need to put your PHD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps - everything your big science brain can muster! Make yourself at home - you’re here for the long haul. Scavenge resources from vacant offices and empty labs, raid vending machines, and steal company property to build a new base of operations as you explore the facility. When it’s time for a change of scenery, pack up your belongings and move them across the facility using handcarts, forklifts, SUVs, teleporters, and more. Don your lab coat and earn your PhD: from Plant Geneticist to Defense Analyst and Structural Engineer (and many, many more), each with its own advantages essential to survival. Combine traits and skills, then level up to earn perks and abilities with your fellow scientists to forge a formidable scientific force. Working at GATE may have been a dream job, but dying here wasn’t part of your five year plan.

Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs or even a car wash. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, it most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "DRAGO entertainment", "publisher": "DRAGO entertainment", "game_tag": ["Simulation", "Economy", "Building", "Singleplayer", "Indie", "Base Building", "Management", "First-Person", "Realistic", "Multiplayer", "Open World", "Relaxing", "Crafting", "Casual", "Funny", "Design & Illustration", "Memes", "Destruction", "Family Friendly", "Choices Matter"], "dev_names": ["DRAGO entertainment"], "minimum_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system Windows 10 64-bit Intel Core i3 3.0 GHz or Ryzen 3xxx 8 GB RAM Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 4GB VRAM Version 11 10 GB available space macOS Big Sur (11.6.8) Any M1 or Intel Macs 2016 or newer. 8 GB RAM M1 or for Intel Macs: Mac mini 2018, MacBook Air 2017, MacBook Pro 13” 2016.

In the car, in the team garage, on the track and every step of the way – teamwork, true grit and human spirit comes together to make the complete championship winning formula. Here is what you can expect from day one of Early Access when the journey begins on the 20th February. Le Mans Ultimate is the official game of the FIA World Endurance Championship and 24 Hours of Le Mans. Play-out the exciting new era for sportscar racing. Le Mans Ultimate offers an immersive game for both seasoned sim racers and those new to the sport and genre, growing and evolving with the real-life FIA WEC series. Drive the latest manufacturer Hypercars from the incredible 2023 centenary season – bristling with the latest technology. Recreate tantalising on track battles between Toyota, Ferrari, Porsche, Cadillac, Peugeot, Glickenhaus and Vanwall. Alongside the Hypercars comes a competitive array of classes. Lock horns in wheel-to-wheel LMP2 competition as well as the ultra-close, thunderous GTE cars. Drive for supremacy for famous brands such as Aston Martin, Corvette, Ferrari and Porsche. 12 cars will be available from day one with over 100 different livery variations. Enjoy the pulsating challenge of racing around some of the most revered circuits in the world including the seven destinations on the 2023 calendar:  Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Sebring International Raceway, Bahrain International Circuit, Algarve International Circuit (Portimão), Fuji Speedway and the legendary – Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans – the playground for the ultimate racing experience. Le Mans Ultimate uses the industry leading physics and handling simulation DNA from pMotor 2.5 as used and improved from rFactor2 – and builds upon that foundation, enabling the game to be more accessible and user friendly to the community with quality of life improvements – removing barriers to entry while also maintaining the key core elements of sim racing. The game will have selectable difficulty level – to allow the player to determine their own skill level with help for first timers allowing adjustable assists. Additionally, language localisation is available for English, French, Italian, German and Spanish speakers. Concise and clear user interface (UI), easy to understand heads up display (HUD) and broadcast style track elements are also features of the game and will immerse the player in the official FIA WEC and Le Mans experience. For those looking for the edge of the seat, wheel-to-wheel competition against real-life drivers, the Online function, powered by RaceControl, will be home to that pulsating challenge. At launch, racers will be able to take part in ranked Daily Races, running regularly throughout the day. This will provide the opportunity to build the player’s Driver and Safety rankings – in the future, this will offer up further opportunities, as the player unlocks higher ranked races and exclusive events when the game develops and grows alongside the real-life FIA World Endurance Championship. Racing game fans will start their Le Mans Ultimate journey in either Offline Race Weekend or Online. Race Weekend will provide the perfect place to start for any driver, as they select a player profile of Beginner, Intermediate or Advanced according to their sim racing experience. This area of play will be the chance to get to grips with the exotic machinery, refine car set-up and learn the circuits while formulating your own FIA WEC race weekend – taking part in Practice, Qualifying and the main Race – adjusting the time of day, session duration and weather conditions to your liking. Le Mans Ultimate will use an advancement in Real Road 2.0 track evolution simulation found uniquely in Studio 397 titles. Like a real race session, the track will begin as a green, relatively gripless circuit at the start of a weekend and rubber in as more cars pass over the racing line – with cars moving the dust, dirt and marbles off-line. Work is being undertaken in several areas, including the dynamic weather effects too, such as rainfall and debris on windscreens and more realistic flow of water and formation of puddles on the circuit.

The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends.

As both emperor and battle commander you must lead one of six playable factions to victory against the threat of extinction! There are no turns. There is no battle mode. There is no strategic mode. It's all one mode and it's all in real-time. Instantly zoom in to control tactical engagements where every missile, turret, and ship is fully simulated and an important part of the battle. Instantly zoom back out to manage your empire where every asteroid, moon, and planet orbits its parent in a slowly evolving strategic landscape. Sins of a Solar Empire II delivers sprawling empires, huge fleets, and completely new and exciting gameplay moments that can only be found in Sins II. Planets orbit their stars in real-time causing the galaxy's structure to slowly change, creating new battle fronts and new opportunities. Players can view the state of the galaxy up to an hour in the future to prepare their strategies. It's War Year 35 and the emergent TEC, alien Vasari, and deviant Advent have been forced to adapt and evolve to survive. Each race features unique starting conditions, gameplay mechanics, units, abilities, items, and technologies. Their game changing new Empire Systems add a whole new level of strategic capabilities: The parent races are further differentiated by unique sub-factions each with their own unique features and play styles that reflect their motivations and goals. For example, the TEC: Primacy is a xenophobic 'human first' empire focused on aggression and the Vasari: Exodus is willing to destroy planets to fuel their mobile empire. A detailed combat simulation adds incredible depth to tactical gameplay. Turrets with their own pitch and tracking speeds make firing solutions important in battles. Fully simulated missiles can be blocked by ships or destroyed by point defense. New mechanics around shields, armor and hull points give greater depth to units and tactical decisions. All planets and ships can now be easily analyzed, customized, and upgraded in one place without the tedium of finding and clicking through all units in your empire. The Intelligent Construction system will queue up the entire chain of prerequisites to fulfill any item, research, or unit build request. The new fleet system includes the ability to request specific reinforcements on the fly. Requested units are automatically queued from the optimal factory and rallied to the fleet. Combined with Intelligent Construction this allows you to focus on the important tactical decisions and big picture strategy. Planet surfaces can now be customized with special items that vary by race and planet type. Capital ships, titans and starbases can also be customized with race specific items to fill gaps in the fleet's composition or target specific strategies. Numerous minor factions now inhabit the galaxy offering trade, auctions for rare items, and with enough influence, access to their most powerful abilities. Will you befriend them or annihilate them to keep your enemies from turning them against you? New features include a new offer / counteroffer system, the ability to give or demand planets, and the game changing time locked cease-fires that prevent your 'ally' from backstabbing you until it expires - but keep on eye on the time! The Sins II engine can utilize all available cores and RAM to maximize performance, now and into the future. Dynamic lighting, physically based rendering, higher resolution textures and more create a beautiful tapestry. A cloud based online system supports both 'join codes' and lobbies to make it easier than ever to play with others. Games can now be rejoined in progress if a player drops or has to leave; humans can even take over for AI players if a friend joins late. Mod support has been integrated into the game, making it easy to discover, install, and share mods. Custom maps are automatically shared for multiplayer games, preventing the hassle of everyone downloading ahead of time. With an elegant and intuitive user interface Sins II is easy to pick up and play.

Roam the rolling fields, lush forests and other rugged terrains of the island, using skills, guts and cunning to survive. Incredibly complex simulation makes every detail matter. Eat the right diet, keep your wounds free of infection or it won’t just be the physical threats that take your life. Seek to take out other players or join forces while you loot and craft your way to better gear and weaponry. Flex your creative muscles with extensive base building options and reinforcements that will make your fortress impenetrable.

This enormous terrain can be traversed by foot, land vehicles, boats or aircraft. Each location tells its own story, presenting new dangers…and opportunities, too.

Build and protect your base with a wide range of customization options. Grow your character and become the terror of the whole island.

It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time. In UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there’s no chance of winning even a skirmish. The extensive damage system is a foundation of the game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others. While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships. During the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems. Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat's skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy's technological advances. Game's simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit. Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship's trim (tilt) or Earth's curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game. Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands!", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "Deep Water Studio", "publisher": "Deep Water Studio", "game_tag": ["Simulation", "World War II", "Submarine", "Naval Combat", "Military", "Naval", "War", "Open World", "Singleplayer", "Realistic", "Historical", "Action", "Management", "Moddable", "Shooter", "Physics", "Replay Value", "RTS", "Sandbox", "Survival"], "dev_names": ["Deep Water Studio"], "minimum_requirements": "Windows 7 64 Bit / Windows 8 64 Bit / Windows 10 64 Bit / Windows 11 64 Bit Core i3 3.1 GHz or AMD Phenom II X3 2.8 GHz 6 GB RAM GeForce GTX 750 Ti 2GB (1080p Low) or AMD equivalents Version 11 71 GB available space DirectX compatible", "recommended_requirements": "Windows 7 64 Bit / Windows 8 64 Bit / Windows 10 64 Bit / Windows 11 64 Bit Intel Quad Core i7 3770K or AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 8 GB RAM GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB (1080p High), GeForce GTX 1070 8GB (1080p Extreme) or AMD equivalents Version 11 71 GB available space DirectX compatible"}

Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as mysterious dangers await. Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria—known as Khazad-dûm or Dwarrowdelf—in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures. Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or co-op online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there’s clatter, there’s combat. Excavate the mysteries of legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within. • Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-dûm to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses. Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources. • Delve into the depths of the Mines of Moria. Procedurally generated environments are abundant with resources and fraught with mystery and danger, providing a unique experience each and every time. • Find solace from the darkness. Reveal and clear new locations to create architecture on a grand scale. Get creative and construct bases from scratch or build upon the existing environment. Beware the evils which seek to destroy Dwarven progress. • Adventure alone or band together with friends in online cooperative multiplayer. • To survive the treacherous Mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain. • Craft and loot legendary Dwarven armor, tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines. • Establish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril. Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear. But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness. • Discover ancient magic items including swords that glow when Orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom. • Experience the Fellowship of the Dwarves like never before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. • Players become part of Dwarven Legend as they create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator.

You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it! ARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically off of surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail. Advanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall. ARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island, Scorched Earth, Aberration and The Center are released now, with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis. The definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed & ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns.

Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. “This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "VOID Interactive", "publisher": "VOID Interactive", "game_tag": ["Tactical", "Realistic", "FPS", "Shooter", "Multiplayer", "Co-op", "Singleplayer", "First-Person", "Horror", "Action", "Violent", "Gun Customization", "Combat", "Crime", "Modern", "Gore", "Atmospheric", "America", "Co-op Campaign", "Psychological Horror"], "dev_names": ["VOID Interactive"], "minimum_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system Windows 10, Windows 11 Intel Core i5-4430 / AMD FX-6300 8 GB RAM NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 2GB / AMD Radeon R7 370 2GB Version 11 60 GB available space", "recommended_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system 64-bit Windows 10, 64-bit Windows 11 AMD Ryzen 5-1600 / Intel Core i5-7600K 8 GB RAM Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB or better Version 11 60 GB available space"}

Endless opportunities to fight, forage, and forge await you among the island's wilderness and ruins. Channel supernatural forces or wield deadly weapons in a classless, real-time combat system, and fight alone, with a small team, or in massed armies for PvE and PvP battles—the choices are all yours. For thousands of years, Aeternum has been the source of fantastical legends—and now you’ve found it. Shipwrecked and without supplies or allies, you’ll need to make your way in a dangerous world where supernatural power has changed all the rules. In such a land, your destiny is whatever you make of it. Aeternum's mysteries run as deep and dark as its history. Delve into the world and uncover the secret truth of the island and its millennia of strange inhabitants. As you explore Aeternum, you’ll discover beauty, danger, and opportunity at every turn. You'll need to use all your skills to take advantage of the island's bounty—and survive its horrors. Arm yourself with brutal melee weapons, ranged artillery, or supernatural powers and jump into New World's classless, real-time action combat system.

Will you sling spells to support your allies from a safe distance? Only you can decide. At the core of the New World’s social features are the three factions, organizations of like-minded players and non-player characters with their own motives and schemes for the island's future.

What kind of game is this? A. In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate. Pals can be used to fight, or they can be made to work on farms or factories. You can even sell them or eat them! In a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes. Pals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world. Want to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. Don't worry; there are no labor laws for Pals. Make use of Pals and their skills to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort. Some Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead. Letting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is. With Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own. Breed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all! Endangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all. Multiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too. In online co-op play mode, up to 4 players can play together.

They attacked the Demon stronghold with overwhelming numbers and succeeded in its total destruction. All of the demons in the castle were taken prisoner except for one lone skeleton named 'Skul'.

Tackle intriguing projects of different sizes and requirements that help you increase your income, so that you're able to add even more powerful machinery to your vehicle fleet. Along the way, diverse clients will test your abilities as you navigate challenges, making every task a test of your skill set. Get ready to showcase your process as you tackle a variety of construction challenges in this dynamic and engaging adventure! Start your business on two individual maps inspired by landscapes in the USA and Germany. Each of them offers its own campaign that helps you climb the ladder of success. Friedenberg is based on picturesque cities of Southwest Germany, and features enchanting rolling hills and scenic riversides. Here, your objective is to contribute to the design of renewable energy solutions and enhance the local urban infrastructure throughout the campaign. Beyond these significant undertakings, you'll encounter diverse tasks that allow you to put every piece of equipment you earn to the test. Sunny Haven, on the other hand, is a truly American-style harbor city that you have to revitalize to put its tourism industry back on track. Altogether, more than 90 exciting contracts are waiting to be completed on both maps, so you can be sure you'll always come across something new to explore! Dive back into the construction scene with a vehicle fleet that will leave you awestruck by its sheer size! Take your pick from a selection of over 80 machines from official licensing partners, all of which are faithful virtual recreations of their real-life counterparts. Look forward to a colorful mixture of vehicles from previous installments of the beloved franchise, as well as completely new additions to the game. The same goes for the manufacturers behind them: In addition to the well-known Construction Simulator partners Atlas, BELL, Bobcat, Bomag, CASE, Caterpillar©, Kenworth, Liebherr, MAN, Mack Trucks, Meiller-Kipper, Palfinger, Still, and the Wirtgen Group, you now have the opportunity to put machines by Benninghoven of the Wirtgen Group, CIFA, DAF, Doosan, Nooteboom, Scania, Schwing Stetter, and Wacker Neuson to use. Plus, while creating your character, you can choose an outfit featuring officially licensed personal protection equipment from our new partner Engelbert Strauss. You think that's everything? Far from it: The updates Construction Simulator has been provided with since its release not only contain patches, but free extra content too. Several new machines have found their way into the game, including the innovative wheel excavator EW100 by Wacker Neuson and a practical service vehicle for refueling and repairing. New tools and features in the form of enhanced terrain reworks, increased vehicle hall capacity, and a handy flashlight are also part of the updates. And since we don't want you to get bored by taking on the same jobs over and over again, an entirely new tourist area as well as various seasonal contracts have been added on top. All in all, with the initial base game and its updates, Construction Simulator now offers you more than 100 contracts, over 90 machines, and, consequently, almost endless construction fun, which you can experience together with up to three friends in the multiplayer mode.

It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that!

Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.

Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you. Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places.

Compose your very own team of monsters from across the DRAGON QUEST series and engage in thrilling battles against your foes.

With over 500 monsters to choose from and a revamped synthesis system to explore, you can mix and match to you heart's content to create your favorite cute critters and dastardly supervillains, as well as brand-new additions to the monstrous roll call. Your quest to become the greatest monster wrangler of all time starts here! Psaro is cursed and is unable to harm anything with monster blood. Now, he must become a Monster Wrangler to create an army for battle. The hunt for high-ranked monsters takes Psaro through the ever-changing seasons of Nadiria and its unique environments, with rivers of bubbling lava, mysterious ancient ruins, and soaring towers of cake. Along the way, Psaro meets the kind-hearted elf, Rose, who joins his adventure to seek out ever-stronger monsters. The key to Psaro's success lies with synthesis: the ability to combine two monsters and create a stronger offspring. Each new creation brings Psaro one step closer to his goal of becoming the Master of Monsterkind. (The network mode Online Battles from the console version, where players battle one another in real time, is not included.) - A Wondrous World Awaits As time passes in Nadiria, so too do the seasons change, with different weather conditions tempting new monsters out of hiding and revealing paths to undiscovered areas.

While many can be recruited in battle, occasionally a defeated monster will ask to join your team of its own accord. Befriend as many monsters as you can, then combine them to synthesize new creatures and build a unique party to your exact liking. - Enjoy All the DLC from the Console Version The Steam® version includes the DLC packs from the console version: the Mole Hole, Coach Joe's Dungeon Gym and Treasure Trunks.

Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \"Engrams\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \"Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

Iberia is home to numerous historic villages and towns, narrow streets, old churches and impressive castles. Visit the capital of Spain, Madrid, the coastal capital of Portugal, Lisboa, a wide amount of coastal cities like Málaga and Olhão, and many of the inland cities. Be an important part of the strong export economy and deliver cargo from Iberia through Europe. Knowledge is power. You can learn all about Iberia's power sources, nature and economy below. From semi-arid southeastern deserts to the green coniferous forests, the Iberian Peninsula is home to a rich and very diverse ecosystem. With two dominant climate types, temperatures and weather can vary depending on where you are traveling. With Iberia being the second largest European peninsula by area, you can be sure to see a wide range of different eco-regions. Did you know many of western classics based in the wild west of America, featuring traditional cowboy shootouts and close-ups of squinting eyes (yee-haw!), were filmed in the hot and dusty deserts of Spain? Located in the south-east of Iberia and often nicknamed 'mainland Europe's only desert', you will find the Tabernas Desert, a dry but beautiful part of the Spanish mainland. This part of Iberia is the first desert climate to ever feature in Euro Truck Simulator 2; and offers a very unique contrast to the lush and green forests that dominate the rest of the continent. Whether you are just traveling through, or taking the scenic route, be sure to look out for the locations of famous movies, tumbleweed, and cowboys... because this town ain't big enough for the two of us, partner. With over 3,000 km of coastline, a majority of Iberia's largest cities and population are located near or next to the sea, and sea ports in the Iberian Peninsula play an incredibly important role within the economy. Shipping, fishing, and ocean tourism are some of the peninsula's largest industries. You will find many of these larger and smaller ports across the coastline of the peninsula. The ever-increasing demand for more products and shipping means you'll find no shortage of jobs when you are near a port. With hundreds of shipments coming and going every day, you'll be a part of connecting Iberia to the world when it comes to logistics. Thanks to the ports across Iberia with connections to Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Atlantic, shipping across the world makes Spain and Portugal an ideal location for automobile manufacturers. Some of these operations are so large that many ports have their own dedicated car shipping terminals which are solely dedicated to the transporting of automobiles overseas. Play a vital role in delivering parts and cars to and from the various car factories throughout Europe to the shipping terminals. With millions of cars rolling off the production line each, you will have no shortage of logistic jobs in this industry. No matter where you are traveling across the peninsula, you'll be sure to see a wide array of different architecture. There are many common designs you can spot when you are driving in Iberia. Namely, the orange terracotta roofs are found on most villas, houses, and buildings; which have been created from the abundance of clay extracted from quarries in the local region. The most common type of design of buildings is designed with white walls, stone floors, and windows with shutters to help keep out the heat. Howlever, not everything about Iberia is native. From Spanish Colonial (a combination of Native American and Moorish influences) to Neoclassical architecture, it is evident to see influences from around the world found in many of Spain and Portugal's buildings and landmarks. Don't forget to slow down and take a moment to enjoy the history and beautiful architectural design that can be found across both Spain and Portugal. Iberia is achieving high demand for electricity by using modern energy sources instead of using traditional ones such as coal to generate electricity. One of the more popular modern energy sources are solar panels, which uses the sun's energy (which Iberia has plenty of) as way of creating electricity. Solar panels are most effective when large amounts of them are used together on a solar farm. These areas covered by thousands of solar panels provide a sizeable chunk of Spain's and Portugal's electricity. Another source of energy typical for the Iberian Peninsula is from wind captured at turbine farms found on hilltops, in valleys, and even offshore. Through mountains, cities, and forests, drivers often seek refuge from the sun and take the time to rest for the journey ahead at suitable rest areas and designated gas stations designed for truck drivers. With Iberia being one of the leading logistic capitals of Europe, truck stops have become commonplace across the countries of Spain and Portugal. A large majority of gas stations have been handmade which allows a variety of designs to be crafted to match their real-life counterparts as closely as possible. These rest stops also will feature other AI drivers who will pull up for fuel and for a much-needed rest in the parking area.

The corrupting power it contained has engulfed Petrichor V and plunged the planet into darkness. For millennia, The Void Creatures have grown dominant by taking artifacts from our realm to theirs. Now they look to add you to their collection. Bring your friends on the adventure! Only one player is required to own Survivors of the Void to enable the monsters, levels, and items to appear in-game for the whole lobby. Players without Survivors of the Void will be unable to select the two new survivors or permanently unlock new items, logbooks, or other content. Press your advantage on the high ground. Unleash devastating shots from across the map with Railgunner’s first-person scope. Time your reloads, aim for weak spots, and change the battlefield. Railgunner is the ultimate boss killer. Instead of cutting down hordes, she eliminates her target in one shot. Mastering Railgunner’s positioning and movement unleash her true potential. Throw down a Concussion Device to reach an overlook, or to get out of a challenging situation. Railgunner is instantly unlocked for owners of Survivors of the Void. Turn the corruption in your favor and harness the power of The Void. A corrupted commando is torn between controlling his new powers and being consumed by them.

You’ll find that many items now do the opposite of what they once did. The Void ukulele’s electrifying music targets single enemies instead of crowds. Some items do something completely different!

Beware this adorable orange abomination, tread too close and it’s likely to bounce you off a cliff. The most powerful creatures come from The Void. Your ability to reach The Void threatens them. That encroachment won't go unanswered. Constructs of hulking power and corrupted mind have been sent to capture you. Uncover the root of their strength, and if you can, take the fight to them.

Belief systems define social roles for leaders, moral guides, and skill specialists. They invoke rituals from gentle festivals to brutal sacrifices. They guide preferences around food, comfort, love, technology, and violence. They venerate specific animals, desire different apparel and tattoos, and give access to different buildings and strategies. Everything is customizable. Make your own story of pirate nudist cannibals, blind undergrounder mole people, charitable ranching cowboys, machine-obsessed transhumanists, or rustic peaceful tribes who link with curious tree creatures. You can build mind-bending temples with colorful drug motifs, terrifying sacrificial altars clad in skulls, winding mazes of underground tunnels full of technology, or beautiful orchards with drifting leaves. You’ll hold unforgettable rituals - sick dance parties with pounding music, bountiful feasts of human flesh, beautiful skylantern festivals, ceremonial blindings, Christmas festivities around the tree, vicious gladiator duels, and more. As you grow powerful, you’ll hunt for the venerated relics of your belief system in new multi-part quests. Penetrate ancient complexes full of diverse threats. Infiltrate wary tribal villages and hack downed spacedrones while holding off other treasure-hunters. Find the relic in its ancient temple and bring it back to your reliquary to attract wealthy pilgrims to your colony and help you convert even more people to your beliefs. And when you’re successful and secure, you can seek transcendence beyond reality in the new, epic archonexus endgame. Ideology makes your story into more than ever before. Each belief system is built around a collection of 1-4 core memes, where each represents a core idea in the belief system. By combining memes and changing the details of how they are expressed, you can create a near-infinite variety of different belief systems. The memes are: Each meme can give rise to a variety of different . Each precept is a specific rule or guideline which affects a specific behavior or preference. The same meme won’t always imply the same precepts - if you want fine control, you can edit and randomize precepts exactly the way you like. Some precepts relate to issues like: Belief systems each have an underlying These don’t have gameplay effects, but they give variety to how different belief systems look and feel, and the narratives the game generates for them: People can convert each other to new beliefs. You can assign wardens to convert prisoners, or use the special abilities of your moral guide. People will also spontaneously try to convert those around them. Those with proselytizing beliefs will do this much more intensely - which can lead to conflict. Depending on traits, some people are much easier to convert than others. You can bring everyone in your colony to one belief system, or try to keep a diversity of beliefs to capture the benefits of all of them. Make use of your favourite colonists’ strengths and skills by assigning them formal social roles. Each belief system defines special roles that believers can take on. Each belief system defines a collection of unique These player-controlled events are special gatherings that have a variety of impacts depending on how they are carried out. For example, a wild party in a massive dance hall with giant speakers may attract new recruits or lead to the discovery of an ancient complex full of loot. On the other hand, if you throw a party in a field with no music at all, you might not get the same benefits. Belief system-based rituals include: Some rituals aren’t specific to belief systems: A unique type of tree called the Gauranlen tree will occasionally sprout near your colony. These majestic orange trees have a symbiotic relationship with small creatures called dryads. The tree supports the dryads, and in return the dryads protect the tree. Each tree has a few dryads attached to it. A colonist can connect with a tree in a special ceremony. By pruning the tree over time, the colonist can strengthen the connection and gain the ability to influence its dryads. Under your influence, dryads can specialize into different castes: Beliefs matter. If your colonists venerate the trees, they can connect with Gauranlen trees more effectively and influence the dryads more efficiently. Only those who truly respect the trees can control their reproduction. With time, such a tree-connector colony can build an economy and an army from its Gauranlen orchard and the cute, useful, fearsome dryads. Every belief system holds some special objects as relics. It might be an ancient sword, a skull, a piece of armor, or anything else. Embark on multi-part quests to find and collect the relics that you believe in. Hunting a relic involves several kinds of quests to find the relic: Once you’ve found the that holds the relic, you can go there and grab it in a daring raid as you evade and defeat a variety of security systems. Take it home and install it in a reliquary. The relic will help you turn others to your beliefs, and also attract who will bring gifts. Ideology also adds some new quests not related to the relics. quests see you raiding loot-filled ancient complexes, either in a shuttle or by traveling in a caravan. These ancient complexes aren’t about finding a relic - just about getting rich. Complexes are procedurally-generated and contain a wide variety of threats. The threats are designed to interact with each other and even be useful - You can intentionally wake sleeping ancient soldiers to help fight pirates who followed you to the complex, or ignite an ancient fuel node to burn out giant insects nesting in the next room. It can get pretty crazy - this is RimWorld, after all. will set up near your colony. These small communities are lightly-defended and often not associated with any larger faction, making them good targets if you want to become a raider yourself. Beliefs matter - If your beliefs are aggressive, your colonists may even demand this kind of attack be carried out regularly to satisfy their need for dominance. The encampments vary from farms to logging sites, mines, and hunting lodges, each with different kinds of defenders and loot. Groups of will arrive and ask for aid. Help them, and they might reward you later. You can also choose to betray them and enslave them, recruit them, sell them, or anything else. Beliefs matter - if your beliefs are charitable, your colonists will be especially happy when you take care of the needy travelers. Belief systems unlock new buildings. Many of the buildings are used to support rituals. These include: Belief systems also unlock specific new buildables that have specific functions: Each belief system is associated with different aesthetic styles. Styles affect how many things look - rituals, furniture, floors, apparel, and art. Your colonists will enjoy being around things that match the styles of their belief system, and some may reject styles of other beliefs. Styles include: One belief system can mix-and-match several of these together. Make the morbid pirates or techno-Buddhists you dream of. Styles affect apparel in many ways. Animalist believers may shape their recon armor helmets as terrifying animal faces. Morbid death-worshippers will use skull helmets. Spikecore pirates will wear dusters with spiked shoulders. There are many, many visual variations, so every colony will dress different. Styles also affect the artwork your colony produces. Statues will display the iconography of their creators’ belief systems. Some styles also come with specific floors including: Styles are also expressed in new decorative floor coverings: Beyond styles, belief systems can make people want to wear specific items of apparel. Some of these can be specific to certain social roles as well - a priest or moral leader may need to wear a special hat or robe. Ideology includes a variety of new apparel items believers might want: Colonists also want new and and related to their beliefs. They can visit a to recolor garments using dyes harvested from the new tinctoria crop, change tattoos, or restyle their beard and hair. You can enslave prisoners or purchase slaves from traders. Slaves will work on most tasks like colonists, at the cost of reduced work speed. Every belief system has an attitude towards slavery - some find the practice abhorrent, while others accept and even demand slaves as part of their beliefs. You can arm your slaves and command them directly in combat. But watch out - slaves will rebel if they get the opportunity or they are not sufficiently suppressed. Your wardens can suppress slaves by periodically threatening them. You can use structures like terror statues and gibbet cages to passively suppress slaves. You can also make slaves wear special collars and body straps to keep them under control. As your colony grows wealthy, you’ll have the opportunity to sell the whole thing and start anew with your favorite colonists and animals. In return, you’ll receive a piece of a map that leads to the - a conduit through which an ancient machine superintelligence is said to affect the physical world. This quest acts like a partial game reset where you will start over with your selected colonists and animals. You can keep your favorite characters while moving to a new colony in a new place and progressing on an epic quest. Each new colony appears next to an ancient archotech structure of increasing psychic influence. Study each structure to unlock further pieces of the map. Unlock three pieces, and you can locate the archonexus itself, invoke its power, and transcend physical reality through the mind of the machine god.

The vast map is comprised of 46 cities and approximately 340 regions. The regions are collections of detailed territories, and the struggle for land is intuitively expressed through a color scheme. Players can conquer territories to unite the land and fly their colors more elaborately and more freely. When troops are on the march, and the march origin city is connected to land controlled by the players’ forces, the supply lines will be maintained and troops can battle with ample supplies provided to them. However, if the connection with the march origin city is cut, the troops will lose their supply lines and will be weakened and fall into a disorderly state. Securing the supply lines is an integral part in maintaining the battle front. Players can organize the administration, the center of power, as an element that expands the player's strategy. Administration is shown in an organization chart, and as retained officers are added to the organization, various commands and effects are obtained. It is important to make administration that suits your own strategy. More than 1,000 unique officers, which is the largest in the series, are in the game, and each officer is given a “character” (trait). There are more than 150 characters, with some being useful in battle, some in administration and so on. Some officers possess a powerful and unique character, and arranging the right officer in the right place will help in shortening the path to conquering territories.

Will you spend your days crawling through dungeons, searching for treasures and raw materials with which to craft your equipment? Or will you answer the call to adventure, traversing the seas and seeking out great foes to test your prowess? Recruit settlers with particular skills and work alongside them to mine a wide variety of ores, craft gear tailored to your preferred playstyle, and establish a flourishing village. Play singleplayer or co-op - or establish a dedicated server with hundreds of other players. The world is infinite and adapts to whatever mode you choose. Grow your settlement from humble beginnings, establishing orchards, farms, and workshops alike. Recruit settlers that can work your fields, tend to your animals, and acquire resources without needing your constant attention and supervision. Use their expertise to help prepare for your next expedition as they expand your settlement's capabilities. Hire guards and craft traps to defend against the many dangers of the world. Sell your wares and use your wealth to trade with neighboring settlements, acquiring much needed equipment well ahead of what would otherwise be possible. Whether playing alone or with a few friends, or even creating a dedicated server for hundreds of players, the world of Necesse and its threats adapt to provide a meaningful challenge. Explore freely or take on specific quests as you face off against unique monsters spread across a variety of biomes. Will you be a deadeye archer, a melee champion, or a master of the magical arts? Will you and your friends establish separate competing colonies, or will you pool your resources and divide roles to build a giant settlement together? When faced with a tough boss, will you team up to form a carefully balanced party with powerful synergies, or will you attempt to steal all the glory for yourself? Cut down trees, mine and process ores, pick herbs, and harvest the bodies of defeated monsters to craft everything from walls and furniture to armor, potions, scrolls, trinkets, and weapons. While some unique equipment can only be acquired by defeating special enemies, everything else can be crafted through a multitude of workshops to equip yourself, your visiting friends, and your loyal settlers. Unlock additional gear as you acquire new resources and discover countless ways to craft, build, and play – endless combinations of equipment means there's always something new to try. Play as you want, customizing difficulty and multiple gameplay rules to fit your preferences. If you don’t like raiders showing up at your settlement, turn them off, and fine-tune gameplay rules like the length of the day/night cycle or the difficulty of boss battles however you like. From pet parrots and penguins to genie lamps, ostrich mounts, and unique outfits, Necesse has countless options to explore.

You decide where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory? The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat.

You will grow to become immortal, conquer the beasts from the Classic of Mountains and Season, make your choices carefully and grasp your own destiny. Step into the enchanting world of the Tale of Immortal, where cultivation is an art that requires more than just financial means and help from fellow cultivators. To truly master it, one must possess a deep understanding of the craft and have access to the right cultivation venues. But that's not all—the journey is fraught with danger, as you'll face unpredictable monsters, crisis-ridden mystic realms, insurmountable barriers, and brilliant treasures waiting to be discovered. As a novice cultivator in the Qi Refining stage, you'll set out from Yukong Village to cultivate your inner strength, defy the odds, and overcome adversity. With each breakthrough, you'll be able to rewrite your destiny and cleave through the thorns on your journey. Cross continents, witness the wonders of the world, and then ascend to Tian Yuan Mountain, where the ultimate enlightenment of the Way awaits. Embrace a fully-realized NPC world, where each character is a unique entity with their own friends, family, and life trajectory— completely independent of your progress. However, if you choose to meddle, you certainly can! The game is yours to shape as you wish. Collaborate with your beloved to save the day, seek revenge alone, or even become the enemy of all. The choice is yours to make. Master martial arts, teach NPCs the Taoist Mind, learn from seasoned gurus, and accept eager disciples. You can also take on the NPCs in the auction house and follow it up by drawing your sword or claiming your hard-earned spoils. As part of a group of immortal cultivators, you can either shine bright or cultivate in secrecy. It's all up to you and the path you choose to take. Are you ready to embark on a thrilling adventure? One where you might become the hero who saves the day and wins the heart of the love of your life? Or maybe you're looking to stir up some jealousy in your crush and have them fight for your affection? How about fulfilling a fifty-year-old promise or getting caught up in the struggle of a mysterious organization? Perhaps you'll uncover a long-forgotten treasure, only to have it snatched away by a cunning adversary? The possibilities are endless! But that's just the beginning! As you journey through this immersive world, apart from interacting with a rich cast of NPCs, you'll encounter a plethora of random events and side tasks that will keep you on your toes. Some might leave you feeling frustrated or hurt, while others could be just the thing to save you or make you stronger after facing danger head-on. Every decision you make will shape the narrative, leading to a unique and unforgettable story that's yours alone. Do you want to take your sect to new heights of power and glory? We've got the ultimate sect management gameplay that lets you experience the full range of sect life: from humble disciple to mighty sect master. Join a massive sect and work your way up from the bottom, or take on the challenge of leading a fallen sect back to prominence. As a Disciple, you'll complete sect missions, compete in sect tournaments, and fight for glory and resources for your sect. As an Elder, you'll be responsible for teaching and guiding your disciples, assigning tasks, and accelerating the sect's growth. The real power and responsibility, however, lie with the Sect Leader. You'll need to keep order in the sect, plan strategic attacks and defenses, and fight for precious resources like Spirit Mines. If you're ambitious enough, you can even conquer other sects and seize their exclusive \"Rewrite Destiny\" and manuals. Achieve your wildest ambitions and unify the world, as long as you have the strength and the drive to make it happen. To embark on an epic adventure, you need to hone your skills and become a true warrior. Start by building a solid foundation of cultivation. Your mind skills are crucial to success, so focus on cultivating a powerful mindset. From there, you can delve into martial and spiritual skills to take your abilities to the next level. As you explore, keep an eye out for opportunities to create edges with your motion and special skills. And don't forget to tap into your ultimate skills to save the day when necessary. There are a dozen of manuals to choose from, each with its own unique characteristics. Will you specialize in one of the twelve Spiritual Roots, or master them all? What school of martial arts will you establish? The choice is yours. There are treasures to be found in every corner of this world. From the Manual Pavilion to the mystic realms and beyond, you never know what you might discover. And with hundreds of rare and exotic monsters, fellow cultivators, ghosts, demons, and immortals to test your strength against, you'll never be bored. If you're up for a challenge, why not try your luck at the Immortal Tournament or the Master Rankings? Can you break through the barriers of the Nether Mountains? Will your school rise to the occasion and prove its worth? As you journey through this perilous world, your school will be put to the test. Sharpen your skills and harness the power of tools! At the start, you get to choose from three formidable weapons, each offering a distinct cultivation system. The Bagua Jade grants you the ability to revive yourself and your chosen ally, the Eye of Providence allows you to steal Beast Skills and gain unparalleled insights into the world, and the Mythical Gourd empowers you to capture a Boss and enlist it as your loyal sidekick: command it to fight by your side or to search for treasure on your behalf. And that's not all. Refine your own Artifacts and summon Artifact Spirits to fight by your side. These Spirits not only offer you companionship but also trigger exclusive adventures and provide invaluable assistance. Moreover, hone your skills in practicing Alchemy and Talismans, mastering the art of Geomancy and Feng Shui, and crafting a plethora of items to assist you in your explorations. Confuse your enemies, slay your foes, and emerge victorious every time!

Inject new Legendary Lords, Heroes, and Units into your games to vastly expand your methods of play on the campaign map and within battles. The Changeling, Yuan Bo, and Mother Ostankya each bring their own unique campaign mechanics to their faction, with goals separate from the Realm of Chaos campaign, and new units to help them pursue victory on their terms. I make my home in the darkest pits of your soul. In the shadows, I bide my time. As a mighty Horror of Tzeentch, the Changeling embodies the Changer of Ways’ most deceiving and manipulative tendencies. Able to morph into any legendary character from the noble to the fearsome, the Changeling’s true form has been lost to time. His trickery may even deceive the Dark Gods themselves, able to mirror foes, create false allies, and disrupt empires from within, with only one truth becoming clear long after he’s enacted his handiwork. The deceiving prankster of the known world, the Changeling of Tzeentch, was here. As a spellcasting shapeshifter bolstering the Lore of Tzeentch, the Changeling can adopt the form of any lord he faces, making his battle efficiency grow stronger as your enemy tries to do the same. When not fighting directly, he lingers in the shadows, stalking his prey, and waiting for the optimal time to strike. Trust no one. The Changeling’s inscrutable and random nature is the perfect recipe for schemes and trickery. For the Changeling, the world is divided into Theatres; segmented regions that contain Schemes, both minor and pivotal. Fuelled by an unending legion of tricksy cultists, to achieve his goals he must first break a Theatre down through smaller, cheekier Schemes by constructing buildings, stealing identities, and instigating tensions amongst otherwise civilized populations, culminating in a Grand Scheme and an epic battle for supremacy, rife with bountiful rewards along the way. Gold, Grimoires, and Rifts aplenty. With enough Grand Schemes carried out, the Changeling’s final purpose is within reach: conducting the Ultimate Scheme for campaign victory. This troublesome Legendary Hero, the Blue Scribes, ride atop their Disc of Tzeentch, scribbling on parchment as they go, and are capable of spewing all manner of spells across the battlefield by verbalising their scrolls. If only they knew what those words meant... Ruling over Central Cathay, Yuan Bo, the Jade Dragon leads the Court of Celestial Sorcerers. A bureaucrat of the highest order on the surface, yes, but a talented spymaster at heart, the Jade Dragon runs the city of Wei-jin and, by extension, is an administrator for the Cathay empire. Liked by all, the good of Grand Cathay is in capable hands. Serving two roles between his human and dragon forms, the Jade Dragon can be a devastating single target destroyer, and a potent spellcaster with the Light, Yin, and Heaven lores of magic. Soar above the battlefield as a dragon, burning down even the strongest of enemy units, or take the fight on the ground with game-changing spells at your side. Cathay stands, all the same. Engage in a chess match unlike any other with the Matters of State. As a master statesman, a right hand to the emperor and a spymaster, Yuan Bo’s influence over the kingdom runs deep. With this power, enact overt and covert policies across settlements, armies and even characters to best suit your empire’s needs. Crack down on settlement corruption, rush construction for your entire empire in a single move, create diplomatic deadlocks to move freely through unfriendly territories, and much, much more. Go beyond mere balance and embrace disharmony, leveraging it as an excuse to serve more severe and extreme actions to fit your agenda, and plan chains of actions to ensure the balance of harmony is pulled back in your favour when all is said and done. Yuan Bo doesn’t follow the rules. He writes them. With a plan centuries in the making under the request of Yuan Bo’s father, the Jade Dragon is tasked with travelling to critical locations and constructing relays to empower the Jade Compass, before defending them from the Lizardmen incursions trying to dismantle Cathay. Destroy them, and plot a course to victory. Tales of monsters and bogeymen have haunted many lands for centuries, but the tale hanging above the Kislevite children, a reminder of the consequences for displaying disobedience, was not just a tale. Mother Ostankya is real. A guardian, faithful to the land, holding anyone who seeks to harm it accountable, she draws her power from the very woods, fens and oblasts that she protects. When war comes knocking, she’ll be on the front lines, protecting the warriors of Kislev, and inflicting her terror upon any who oppose them. And if you cross her path, make no mistake. Mother Ostankya will punish you. As a powerful sorceress with a bespoke melee component, Mother Ostankya utilises her cauldron on and off the battlefield, able to rain spirits down upon her foes from afar or sprout the legs of a spider in melee combat as an artillery-chariot hybrid. The Daughters of the Forest must infuse Mother Ostankya’s Witchcraft at the Witch’s Hut. With a new rare resource, Spirit Essence, you can take advantage of ingredients gathered during your playthrough to create potent Incantations and utilise Hexes to vastly change the course of your entire campaign. Force enemy armies from your lands in an instant, purge entire provinces of corruption in a single move, buff your units far beyond their given capability, and unleash the full might of the witch as you search for the Malediction of Ruin; Mother Ostankya’s final Hex to secure the sanctity of Kislevite land. Welcome a world of change with new additional units for Tzeentch, Grand Cathay, and Kislev. Field an abomination with the Mutalith Vortex Beast for Tzeentch, a horrific fusion of monster and magic, created by the powers of Chaos beyond any justifiable reason. It brings raw, magical destruction to the table with violent spectacle. It won’t take a compass to find the new additions to the Cathayan roster. Crafted by the wizards of the Celestial Court, Guardian Lions are living statues made from Jet or Jade. For those seeking a magical touch, the Jade Lion is a sorcerer's conduit, able to use spells bound to its body and launch flaming attacks. The Jet Lion, however, is the opposite, countering magical spells to diminish any sorcery that may harm themselves or those nearby. Plus, new Kislevite units lurk in these woods. A terrible and frightening creature, known to many as The Thing in the Woods, brings its enormous size and infantry sundering capability to the frontlines of Kislev. Left unchecked, this beast will tear through enemy troops like paper, before rushing into the woods for cover and emerging to do it all over again. And, of course, further horrors await within the Shadows of Change.", "review_summary": "Mixed", "developer": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "publisher": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "game_tag": ["Strategy", "Action", "Dark Fantasy", "Grand Strategy", "Fantasy", "RTS", "Turn-Based Strategy", "Psychological Horror", "Real Time Tactics", "Atmospheric", "Singleplayer", "Online Co-Op", "Tactical", "War", "Co-op", "Multiplayer", "PvP", "Colorful", "Story Rich"], "dev_names": ["CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "Feral Interactive"], "minimum_requirements": "Windows 7 64-bit Intel i3/Ryzen 3 series 6 GB RAM Nvidia GTX 900/AMD RX 400 series | Intel Iris Xe Graphics Version 11 120 GB available space This game may be updated over time and have paid for and free. additional content released for it.

Immerse yourself in the various environments of the Birdverse of Goose Goose Duck. A game of social deduction where you and your fellow geese must work together to complete your mission. However, keep an eye out for those malicious Mallards and other birds that have infiltrated your team and will do anything to stop you. Play online with 5-16 players, and work together (or against each other) to complete your objectives - whether that’s living to fly another day, or making sure that you’re the last feathered friend standing! During meetings, try to trick the gaggle with fluff and deception, or be faithful to your flock with the truth! Complete your tasks throughout the map to fill the task bar, or vote out the disguised birds of prey to complete your mission. Each Map has a unique set of features and interactability, with Sabotages that can impair visibility, communications, and even perform Environmental Kills. With secret passageways and hiding spots, you can sneak around through Vents, Lockers, Sewers, or Fog Passageways to help you fool the flock. Complete tasks before being sabotaged, or Kill enough geese to end the mission. If you can figure out the ducks, vote them out of the game! In Draft Mode, each player is assigned a hidden number. When your number is up, you can choose between one of three roles, or you can choose a random role for the game. Hoot & Seek is a Social Deduction Hide and Seek mode. There are three roles: Spotters, Snipers and the Owl. As the hunters, your goal is to locate and take out the Owl to win. As the Owl, your goal is to survive and blend in with the crowd while completing task objectives to win. Tastes Like Chicken is a Social Deduction Battle Royale. Protect your team's chicken and kill everyone else. Teammates take turns selecting their roles. Teams consist of one chicken accompanied by ducks. A more challenging and advanced version of the Classic Mode, which introduces the Corruption Mechanic and several Corruption related roles. Corruption tokens can be collected throughout the map to lower sabotage cooldowns, or to power up abilities for the Ducks. For a goose, picking up corruption or becoming corrupted can cause some visibility impairments that can be deadly. Complete your tasks to cure your corruption! One Duck is on a Killing Spree, trying to kill everyone before the time runs out. Geese, complete your tasks to reduce the timer, or hide from the Duck. Completing a task will reduce the timer by 4 seconds while alive, or by 1 second when dead. The red team of morphing ducks are trying to kill the blue team before the timer runs out. The blue team is a vulture that reduces the timer by eating corpses and is partnered with a falcon who kills faster than the ducks in games with more than 6 players. Villagers complete tasks to call meetings. Vote out the monster or survive to win. The monster has the ability to turn players into Thralls, turning them to their side. Thralls are powered up by the monster’s abilities for varying boosts in hopes to turn the whole lobby to win. Customize your goose with over 1000 cosmetics including Hats, Costumes, Farts, Pets, Death Stingers, Player Cards and Banners! And 20 colors to choose from for your goose base. Express yourself, dress silly, go in character, mix and match! Through gameplay and modes, there are achievements that can unlock additional cosmetics. Earn rewards and reach benchmarks as you play!

Developed by Team Ladybug, creators of multiple fantastic action games thus far. “...Now, let’s begin my world.” Remilia Scarlet, head vampire of the Scarlet Devil Mansion sends her maid Sakuya Izayoi with no warning to a world much like Gensokyo, but not quite. A world full of strange places, filled with strange youkai and her time manipulation sealed. What could Remilia’s end game be...? ・Time stop system from character's Ability and Gimmick maps that use special abilities like time stop. ・Adapt the \"graze\" system of the Touhou Project into a 2D game, giving you a sense of tension in approaching to the enemy. ・Graphics that bring out the appeal of Touhou world, such as attractive dot Graphics. Team Ladybug began with \"Pharaoh Rebirth,\" continuing with other enjoyable games including \"Resurrection of Beldia\" and \"Shin Megami Tensei SYNCHRONICITY PROLOGUE.\" Since, I have been waiting in anticipation for their next project. This time, they have created a fan fiction game based off the world-renowned \"Touhou Project.\" From the background to the character's movements and various skills, one can feel the creator's passion for games and love of the Touhou project. While it has a Metroidvania style, the game can easily progress without the insistence of repeat elements or collecting items. This has resulted in a spectacular game born from the game production skills cultivated by Team Ladybug. And I personally want to highlight the beauty of the anime sprite. You can see the attention to detail the creator put into not only the leading character's movements, but the effects and enemy characters. Touhou Luna Nights is not only for Touhou fans but one that can be enjoyed by anyone who loves 2D action games.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "Team Ladybug", "publisher": "Team Ladybug", "game_tag": ["Metroidvania", "Female Protagonist", "Bullet Hell", "Faith", "Side Scroller", "Time Manipulation", "Exploration", "2D", "Platformer", "Pixel Graphics", "Action-Adventure", "Beat 'em up", "Cute", "Anime", "Action", "Controller", "Singleplayer", "Adventure", "Indie", "Great Soundtrack"], "dev_names": ["Team Ladybug", "WSS playground"], "minimum_requirements": "Windows 2000 / XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10 Intel Core2 Duo or higher 2 GB RAM Open GL compliant video card 50 MB available space", "recommended_requirements": "Windows 2000 / XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10 Intel Core2 Duo or higher 2 GB RAM Open GL compliant video card 1 GB available space"}

You are Watcher. You dutifully fulfil your purpose in service of the ALLMOTHER, until the day you learn a shocking secret that changes everything. In the near future we learn we are not alone in the universe. A mysterious alien race of giant entities arrives. We call them the Occupants. They are not hostile, but it doesn’t matter. Their arrival is a death sentence. Humanity is wiped out in a matter of months, succumbing to a disease the Occupants have brought to our planet. There is one survivor, a teenage girl called Iris. Somehow she is immune. 1000 years later. Iris is not only immune but immortal. She has birthed a new society consisting exclusively of her own clones. She calls them Sisters. They call her the ALLMOTHER. Unlike the ALLMOTHER, the sisters are not immune. They must wear masks 24/7 to avoid breathing the diseased air even in the Orchard - an underground bunker where they live in constant fear of an Occupant attack. The ALLMOTHER lives in her own compound on the front line of the war with the Occupants. All Sisters dream of one day being able to take the train and join her in the fight. Within the Orchard, every sister has an assigned function, while six sisters have special roles to play… And you - the new . Your role is unique. You have the great privilege of reliving and interpreting the memories of the ALLMOTHER through a process known as Communion, made possible by Secretary, your floating AI companion. As the game begins, you are excited to embark on your first Communion. But all is not well. Your closest sister, Fixer, comes to you with a dangerous revelation. You have been lied to. The ALLMOTHER is not what she claims to be. Fixer’s claims rock the foundations of your world, throwing everything you know and believe into doubt. After Fixer is executed for her treason, it falls to you to discover the truth. Dive into the memories of the ALLMOTHER. Explore pivotal moments in her life from high school days and the arrival of the Occupants to the creation of the Orchard and the birth of the first sisters. Jump back and forth through moments in time within these memories to solve puzzles and access locked off areas and secrets. In between Communions, explore the Orchard - a large underground hub area which houses you and your sisters, has many characters to speak to, and holds many things to uncover. Find the truth and reclaim your legacy. Experience perspective shifts both literal and metaphorical as the game blends between 3rd person adventure, visual novel and first person walking simulator while throwing twists, turns and revelations at you until you question everything you think you know. Born from an eclectic set of inspirations, including the games of Yoko Taro (NieR:Automata), the anime of Satoshi Kon (Perfect Blue) and Naoko Yamada (A Silent Voice), and even the theatre of Robert Wilson (Einstein on the Beach), 1000xRESIST tells a story in ways only a game can while simultaneously bringing fresh ideas to interactive storytelling from theatre, dance, performance art, and cinema. Enjoy more than 10 hours of playtime brought to life with over 15,000 lines of fully voiced dialogue from a brilliant cast of Asian-Canadian actors and an incredible soundtrack from two composers. 1000xRESIST is created by sunset visitor 斜陽過客, an independent studio based in Vancouver (Canada) dedicated to telling diverse stories through the lens of speculative fiction.

It’s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique, and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance. Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora, just like in the gif above. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection! Dogs need a place to call home, and it’s up to you to create an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you’d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you can prioritize whatever you like the most! The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects. Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe, but it’s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that’s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled itself into a particularly tight space.

Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc. The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer. is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm? The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning. In you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath. The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed. If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter , so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected! One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use. A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from. The RPG-like perk-based progression system in will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities.

Design cars, tanks and planes from a huge library of blocks. Scavenge, craft and buy new parts in order to survive and become the ultimate planetary prospector. Start your career as an Intergalactic prospector in search of profit and glory in Campaign, build to your heart's content in Creative mode or pit your Techs against the clock in the Gauntlet Challenge. Team up with other intrepid prospectors in Co-op Campaign, build and create together in Co-op Creative, go head-to-head for glory in the Deathmatch Arena or battle for supremacy in Sumo. Using the building blocks, guns, wheels, and wings from several Mining Corporations, you can build varied Techs to suit every purpose. Be it powerful armoured combat vehicles, unstoppable resource gathering machines, sprawling resource processing bases or a hybrid of all three - creativity is your key to exo-planetary success. The worlds in TerraTech are procedurally generated and infinite, so there are always new lands to discover and more resources to find. Treacherous mountain ranges, luscious grasslands and huge deserts are among the biomes you will encounter. More will be added as development progresses. The intergalactic mining industry is a profitable one, but you are not the only miner in search for new worlds to exploit. Defending yourself from rival miners will take time, resources and skill, with success leading to new territory and new lands. All equipable blocks and items can be damaged or destroyed, so ensuring you are sufficiently armed and ready for battle is a key element of both survival and prosperity in TerraTech. Get out there and show them who’s boss! By gathering and processing natural resources, players are able to construct storage, refining and construction bases in order to craft new blocks in the game. Like the look of that Venture Hail Fire Rifle that just tore your vehicle apart? Go prospecting for the needed resources, and craft a couple for yourself in the shiny new Venture fabricator which you just acquired, by beating their time trial challenge in the nearby mountains. All exo-planetary prospectors buy parts from the established Mining Corporations, where each have their own specific brand of mining technology. Get the job done with GSO, strip-mine to the max with the heavy-duty GeoCorp, zoom around with high-performance recon specialists Venture, function with military efficiency utilising the stealth focused Hawkeye, gain technological superiority with Enviro-giants Better Future or experiment with the bizarre weaponry of Reticule Research.

All of the objects within the Selection Area are selected, along with the Ground, any Effect Layers, and the Ground Textures. Use advanced options and filters to make your selection, then move, rotate, delete and perform many more actions on that selection. The gizmo is an important new concept in Trainz. Gizmos can be used to move or rotate the selected objects, splines, terrain, and ground textures in any direction. Each selected spline segment will display three gizmos - one for each vertex, and a single gizmo for the entire segment. When an object is selected, it is highlighted, and shows a Contextual Menu icon based upon the Asset Category. Clicking the Menu Anchor will open the Contextual Menu, which lists a range of additional operations that can be applied to the selection. Different options are offered depending on the active tool and object types selected. S20 introduces a new system of Palettes that can each be moved, resized, minimised, shown, or hidden, so you can customize the layout of your workspace. Palettes can provide detailed information about your selected objects, or a set of controls used to edit and manipulate everything within the world. The Assets Palette lists all the assets available to you to use in the Route you are creating. To quickly narrow down the list of assets, use the preset Category Filters by clicking on any of the Filter icons or select a custom list/picklist. Advanced functionality helps find objects in your route by using clever filters like \"Filter Selection\" or \"Filter Visibility\" on the assets listed. Asset thumbnails can now be displayed in 3D within the Asset Palette. This provides you with the flexibility to choose between the traditional 2D thumbnails or the option to view each asset with a 3D thumbnail. This enhancement aims to assist you in easily identifying the assets that best suit your needs when creating your route. The Tools Palette provides a range of powerful tools that can be used to build your Trainz world. No more single tool for a single asset type. Use one tool across multiple assets! List all route, session and effect layers to have them always in view and to show the current layer you are working in. The Brush Tool is now multi-purpose and used to painting ground textures, effect layers, scrapbook assets and terrain manipulation. And your brush is now unlimited in size! Use the Eyedropper Tool to identify Assets in the 3D world, add them to picklists, get the ground height or instantly pick rolling stock, ground textures, scenery assets or splines and start painting or placing more. No more teeny tiny 3D asset preview window. The new Preview Palette allows you to resize and reposition it to always have a clear 3D preview of the selected asset. Unlimited brush radius size, instantly see object and compass positions, easily find which layer you're working in or an object belongs to, perform bulk operations on multiple assets types and so much more!

For over a century, the neighboring nations have fought fearlessly, trying to drive the enemy back — but to little avail. Now, you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel, backed by noble paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else entirely? Lead your army and challenge mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will leave you — and the world itself — forever changed.

Choose from 25 classes, 12 character races, and more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities to suit your personal playstyle. Your decisions have more weight than ever before. Your goal is clear, but you must forge your own path to it. Who will die, and who will live? Who will stay, and who will go? Make your choices, and watch the world around you change. Enjoy two combat modes as you slay your enemies – real-time with pause or turn-based. Switch between them on the fly, so you can always take things as slowly — or as quickly — as you like. The unique Pathfinder ruleset also allows you to perform advanced combat maneuvers, like mounted combat. Use them wisely! A cast of more than 10 unique companions is ready to join your cause. Earn their trust and respect, and they will have your back no matter what dangers lie ahead. And if you get on their bad side, well… Maybe it’s time to part ways. You will need much more than a party of adventurers to cleanse the land of its demonic scourge.

Explore nine unique Mythic Paths: obtain extraordinary abilities and shape everything that comes next.

Weeks have passed since the zombie virus took hold of humanity, and most of the population has already been infected. As one of the few remaining survivors, you must finally venture out to join up with the other survivors at the Terminus. Battle your way through hunger, frigid temperatures, and ravenous zombies to make it to the Terminus—escape the city through whatever means possible, or even develop a vaccine! Each journey for survival is different, as the very city you battle through to survive is procedurally generated. Over 150 different areas are generated, with numerous locations to discover, hundreds of items to scavenge, and endless zombies to evade or fight. No two games are ever the same, but the journey to the Terminus is uniquely challenging each time. Choose your next move carefully! Every movement, action, and decision you make deducts from your Action Points (AP). Strategic management of your AP is key to survival. Use too little, and you might not find the resources needed to survive. Use too many, and you may leave yourself open to attack. Maintain your condition to stay in fighting shape during this apocalypse. Surviving isn't easy—you'll need to eat, sleep, and stay warm.

Clawing your way across the city, you’ll occasionally encounter other uninfected survivors. Band together with them on your journey, trade goods, or steal their supplies and find your own way to survive the end of the world. Soldier, police officer, firefighter, farmer—each one will fare differently in an apocalypse, but it’s up to you to discover which one stands the best chance of surviving. Pick from 15 different classes, traits to unlock, and stats to upgrade as you build the ultimate survivor.

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before. France, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken. Many real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other. Use ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target. Use workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal. Invade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation. Customise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode.

Monsters beyond your imagination, and you: The Manager. A roguelite monster-management simulation inspired by the likes of the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13. Order your employees to perform work with the creatures and watch as it unfolds; harness greater energy, and expand the facility. One disaster will lead to another, until everything has fallen into chaos. “I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.” Our game was inspired by the monsters birthed of various inspirations featured in games, film, and series, such as the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13. Going further, it was developed with this thought: You will be playing as the Manager of Lobotomy Corporation, a company in which such creatures are contained and managed. Order your employees to perform work with and on the creatures and watch the results expectantly. Gather energy produced by the monsters and fulfill the quota each day, expand the facility, and manage even more strange beings. In this game, the player will face an ever-present sense of tension and dread as they progress through each day. , or so it seems on the outside. Join the corporation, and witness the true reality with your own eyes. You will have access to various departments as you harness more energy. The more departments you have unlocked, the more efficient the management of Abnormalities will become. Furthermore, AIs such as Angela and the ‘Sephirot’ will be at your side to provide all the assistance you need for smooth progression. You will have to try your best to keep your employees out of danger while extracting as much energy as possible from the Abnormalities. However, you must learn what types of work you should and shouldn’t perform via trial and error. At first, your eyes, ears, and the in-game manual will be your only hints. Let your intuition pick the work type that might suit the Abnormality best. After that, order the employee who is best suited for the job to work on the Abnormality, and wait for the results. In the process of managing Abnormalities, you will gain the power of information. The amount of energy you can acquire from Abnormalities will depend heavily on the type of work your employees perform. As mentioned before, Abnormalities are beings that need to be treated with great care. Some might dislike the idea of being locked inside a Containment Unit, and Worse still, it could open up other units and cause more Abnormalities to escape. Furthermore, employees eroded or corrupted by certain Abnormalities will have a greatly adverse influence on other employees. Employees brainwashed by Abnormalities might randomly attack those around them, wholly oblivious to what they are doing. In addition, employees may go insane from serious psychic trauma, disobeying your orders and damaging the psyche of other employees around them. If you fail to resolve a situation immediately, it will ultimately spiral out of control and throw the whole facility into chaos. When such a situation does occur, you will have to gather employees to suppress any threat and regain control of the situation, or give up parts of the facility to ensure the company’s safety. The game consists of two main portions: Monster Management and visual Story Segments. Once a day of managing Abnormalities and producing energy ends, the story segment will follow right afterward. As you progress through the missions they give, you will come closer to the truth hidden deep in the company. You may have to ask questions, or answer questions from others.

As you continue your push across the Western Front, you will revisit previous battlefields which will, over time, bear the scars and destruction of earlier encounters. Once lush countryside will degrade into a quagmire, marked with colossal craters left by your undermined explosives. Carve your strategies into the landscape by creating complex trench networks which will remain upon your return, as you seek to push the enemy back inch by inch. Shifting weather also plays a role; as the months draw on in the conflict, you’ll encounter weather changes such as snow and rain which will affect things like artillery performance and unit movement. To secure victory, you’ll need to carefully consider your strategy depending on the conditions. Revel in an authentic historical strategy game that captures the gravity and intensity of The Great War. Partnering with the Imperial War Museums, their expertise enables us to accurately portray these pivotal moments in history. Choose true-to-life infantry, weaponry, artillery and tanks of the time and get into the mind-set of a WW1 Commander as you employ considered tactics and deploy your army across the Western Front.

In these expansions, you’ll conclude the ARK storyline while adventuring through exotic new worlds with all-new mission-based gameplay. Discover, utilize and master new creatures, new craftable items, weapons, and structures unlike anything you have seen yet! The saga is now complete, and hundreds of hours of new story-oriented ARK gameplay await you! This Season Pass gives you access to two new huge story-oriented expansion packs -- Genesis Part 1 and Genesis Part 2 -- as well as a 'Noglin' Chibi cosmetic, a ‘Shadowmane’ Chibi cosmetic, a new cosmetic armor set, and an in-game, artificially intelligent companion called ‘HLN-A’ who can scan additional hidden Explorer Notes found throughout the other ARKs. ARK: Genesis Part 1 (available right now!) ARK: Genesis Part 2 (available June 2, 2021) Exclusive HLN-A cosmetic pet (available right now!) Exclusive Tek Exo-armor cosmetic armor set (available right now!) Exclusive Noglin Chibi pet (available right now!) Exclusive Shadowmane Chibi pet (available right now!) In Genesis Part 1, you wake up within a virtual simulation, you must survive in a world unlike anything you’ve seen before! ARK: Genesis represents a new, story-oriented beginning in ARK’s epic saga of survival. With a strangely familiar companion, you must overcome the simulation’s rigorous tests. Only by fighting, building, taming, and exploring will you uncover the secrets behind this forbidding place. In Genesis Part 2, you’ll emerge into a vast new physical world teeming with strange biomes and exotic creatures, while engaging in extensive story-oriented missions that test your mettle, ingenuity, and survival skills. Wielding an array of powerful new tames, items, weapons, and structures, you’ll journey from idyllic fields through twilit phantasmagoric realms, all the way into a literal hellish heart of darkness. Thousands of years and trillions of miles away from where your story began, you’ll challenge series-villain Rockwell in a final confrontation to determine the fate of humanity. The future is in your hands, Survivor -- one last time! A holographic guide, HLN-A, offers a wide array of missions at varying difficulty levels, for you to tackle at your own pace. Completing missions earns you new map-wide bonuses and Hexagons, which you can spend for extra resources, additional Engram Points, TEK items, travel between environments, and more. Discover hundreds of Explorer Notes, and Environmental Cues throughout the world to learn even more about the history of the ARK saga. ARK: Genesis features beautiful biomes ripe for exploration. In Genesis 1, the simulator tests your mettle across fetid alien bogs, deep undersea trenches, frigid mountain peaks, dangerous volcanic hellscapes… and even the wild low-gravity surface of an alien moon. Conquering each area requires preparation, smarts, and the ability to improvise so that when a volcano rains fire from the sky, an avalanche buries you, or a whirlpool pulls you into the briny deep, you’re ready to meet the challenge! In Genesis 2, you’ll emerge from the simulation into a gargantuan starship filled with unique biomes, including beautiful elysian fields, an exotic twilight realm of highly evolved lifeforms, the depths of outer-space, and even the innards of the ever-expanding Rockwell himself. Each biome presents unique hazards, but also opportunities to acquire new resources and creatures -- including the powerful new ‘Mutagen’ that enables you to further evolve your existing tames! The environments may be dangerous, but that’s nothing compared to the new creatures who call ARK: Genesis home. In Genesis Part 1, you’ll encounter web-spinning spiderlike beasts, cute-but-deadly shapeshifters, sea turtles the size of islands, and lava lizards that act as living forges. Plus, who doesn’t want to fly around on an immense hyperspace-capable space whale? In Genesis Part 2, you’ll find the brain-controlling Noglins, elegant high-tech Stryders, the cuddly mobile-nursery Maewing, and even the laser-shooting, bomb-blasting, barrel-rolling Astrodelphis starfighter -- among other fantastical new creatures and evolved R-Variants of old favorites! You’ll need all the help you can tame, as both Genesis expansions present you with challenging new bosses and minibosses that will take all of your skills to conquer. As you brave the many dangers of ARK: Genesis, you’ll gain access to powerful new tools to aid you. In Genesis 1, you’ll wield weapons like combo-capable plasma claws and remote-guided cruise missiles. Make tools from fishing nets to mining drills, or new vehicles such as hover-skiffs. Build interactive structural elements such as pressure plates, alarm systems, jump pads, ocean platforms and more. In Genesis 2, you’ll learn how to place remote cameras, pull off tricks with a floating skateboard-like Hoversail, take care of your eggs with the high-tech Incubator, shoot arrows made of pure energy with the Tek Bow, even engage in a Real Time Strategy command mode within the new ExoMek --- and far, far more. Whether you’re a go-it-alone survivalist, a weapon-making warmonger, or a base-building architect, these expansions have a crafting project suited for you. ARK: Genesis Parts 1 and 2 together conclude the epic saga of ARK: Survival Evolved -- the ultimate battle between the freedom to evolve, versus the oppression of controlling life’s creation. Which side wins out is up to you, Survivor. Your skills, your tames, your weapons and your builds -- everything that you’ve accomplished is put to the test here, as the future of humanity hangs in the balance!", "review_summary": "Mixed", "developer": "Studio Wildcard", "publisher": "Studio Wildcard", "game_tag": ["Adventure", "Survival", "Massively Multiplayer", "Open World", "RPG", "Action", "Indie", "Dinosaurs", "Multiplayer", "Crafting", "Base Building", "Singleplayer", "Violent", "Sandbox", "Building", "Sci-fi", "Open World Survival Craft", "Co-op", "Dragons", "First-Person"], "dev_names": ["Studio Wildcard", "Instinct Games", "Efecto Studios", "Virtual Basement LLC"], "minimum_requirements": "", "recommended_requirements": ""}

In the future, humanity creates a supercomputer known as the \"CentreBrain\" with the hope of utilizing its powerful computing capabilities to further expand the application of virtual worlds. You are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing Dyson Spheres (a megastructure that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its power and energy) to produce the energy that CentreBrain needs. To construct a Dyson Sphere, you need to utilize automation. Start simple and gradually increase complexity. Maximize the stable output of resources through automated facilities. Connect resources with conveyor belts, transporting raw materials to processing facilities, and then conveying the products to the next stage. Progress from basic transport lines to elaborate plans for factories with diverse outputs. Utilize your production to drive technological advancements, meeting the necessary conditions for building the Dyson Sphere. During the construction, buildings will automatically snap to the grid. When laying conveyor belts, the use of snapping allows for automatic alignment, significantly improving efficiency. This enables the creation of large-scale automated production lines. The construction of the Dyson Sphere relies on vast and efficient factories. The convenient blueprint technology allows you to save your essential plans. You can save factory designs as blueprints and deploy them directly in other locations, eliminating the hassle of repetitive operations. You can construct Dyson Shells on multiple orbits, and each layer of the Dyson Shell can be customized. Connect various nodes on the Dyson Shell, creating the patterns you desire. Each Dyson Sphere is a unique masterpiece crafted by you. Each planet will have unique mineral distribution and ecological characteristics. Every time you enter the game, you can experience a randomly generated and entirely new starmap, with landscapes and resource deposits changing accordingly. Each planet has its own orbit, experiencing the gravitational effects of its star with rotation and revolution, resulting in day and night changes influenced by the star. In addition, there are unique celestial bodies such as neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, and even black holes, awaiting your exploration in this vast universe. The resources on a single planet might be insufficient for such an extensive project. You can harness the abundant resources of other planets. Overcoming the constraints of surface transport, establish your interstellar transportation routes. Interconnect planets with fleets of transport ships, tapping into the unique resources of each planet to ensure an uninterrupted supply of raw materials for your factories. Not only can you paint Icarus in your favorite colors, but you can also customize every component, creating your vision of a futuristic light industrial mech. The Dark Fog has arrived, resenting countless challenges to your factory construction endeavors. In addition to pursuing the goal of building the Dyson Sphere, you must also focus on defending your factories in Rise of the Dark Fog. The Dark Fog will do everything possible to hinder the progress of the \"Dyson Sphere Program,\" with Icarus also being a target of their attacks. Be prepared! Don't rely solely on Icarus to face the overwhelming numbers of the Dark Fog. COSMO has devised contingency plans to assist you in repelling the attacks of the Dark Fog. While constructing factories, you'll need to deploy essential defense structures. The more active your operations, the more frequently the Dark Fog will launch fierce assaults. Utilize your defense facilities to unleash \"fireworks\" and disperse the Dark Fog. We are Youthcat Studio from Chongqing, China. Starting as a team of five, we have grown steadily (though not excessively) as we journey alongside Dyson Sphere Program. Driven by our love for science fiction, we've created this game—taking you from building the first mining machine to establishing automated factories across the cosmos.

Take command and challenge other players in grand-scale warfare on the ground, air, or seas. KARDS is completely free to play with all features available from the start. You can earn all cards through regular gameplay, daily missions and an extensive achievement system. KARDS blends familiar trading card gameplay that make it easy to learn and are combined with innovative mechanics that provide strategic depth and tactical diversity. The innovative frontline mechanics allows you to better protect your support assets and take the battle to your enemy. Rush your enemies with Blitzkrieg tactics, gain air superiority or dig in for bitter defensive warfare until you outproduce and outgun your enemies. Managing your forces is an important part of any military campaign. In KARDS you need to carefully manage your resources (Kredits) between deploying new units, operating units already deployed on the battlefield and disseminating orders to support your battle plans. Your deck is constructed around one of the five major powers of WW2 and competes head to head with other players. Each deck is allowed one ally nation, where you can draw support from to create an edge against the opposition. Depending on what you believe to be a winning strategy, players craft their deck on a combination of units and supporting orders. Move up through the ranks via gameplay from Private to Field Marshall and earn your place in the officer's club while reaping monthly rewards for your rank. All the cards are beautifully illustrated to match the unique WW2-style. Weapons and units have been diligently researched and behave exactly as one would expect based on official documentation, specifications and operational history. Thanks to a vibrant community and active developers, KARDS regularly receives new features and improvements. Meanwhile, several expansions have been released for free. We also conduct regularly tournaments which are suitable for players of all experience levels. Winning prizes in the tournaments range from game items to real money of up to $10,000 USD. 1939 Games is a creative indie studio located in Iceland.

Your librarians will fight for the Library. Combat between the guests and the librarians breaks out as if it were on a stage. Defeated guests turn into books, and the Library grows onward. A good book will allow you to invite new guests with greater secrets. Amass a collection of books and explore the secrets of the City. And eventually, get your hands on… The one singular, perfect book. Library of Ruina is a game that uses the concept of a “Library Battle Simulation”. You will invite guests to the Library and engage in combat with them to gain 'Books' with their stories. Battles are played with the 'Librarians' and the 'Guests' using cards and dice. You can plan against the guests’ moves by looking at the cards they will use and select the most optimal card to oppose them. When combat begins, how the dice from your chosen card fall will determine victory or defeat in the struggle. However, the outcome of the dice is not simply determined by pure luck. Certain effects and variables will shift the outcome of the dice for and against your favor. Be sure to carefully choose which cards you utilize to win the battle with your guests. Behold the outcome of your choices and how luck unfolds as your librarians and guests skirmish. You can go through an exhilarating experience, putting it all on the line with thrills just like betting. Confrontation in the Library is not just about killing your enemies, it is about heightening emotions. The emotions of the librarians and guests rise as the battle progresses, and as it grows fiercer and comes to a head, they will surge. Depending on your librarian's feelings, positive outcomes or powerful effects with penalties can occur. In addition, as the emotional tension of the guests grows, the difficulty of combat increases, yet at the same time, rarer books can be acquired. Furthermore, dialogue can appear depending on the situation of the battle and will make one’s viewing experience of the match unfolding even more enjoyable. A guest who dies in the Library will turn into a book. These books can be a librarian's body, materials to grow the Library, or new cards for battle. You can also use books as the parts of an invitation to bring forth another guest. Invite different guests to acquire various books, then utilize them accordingly. How you make use of your collection to grow the Library is up to you. In Library of Ruina, you will be witness to the stories of Angela, the Sephirot, and Roland following the ending of Lobotomy Corporation. You will also watch various events occurring around the huge city in which the Library is located.

See a big metropolitan area of Denver on the edge of the Great Plains, travel across the beautiful Rocky Mountains and through deep canyons to see vast desert landscapes around Grand Junction. Whet your appetite for this beautiful state by reading more about its diverse nature, industries and cities. Colorado has one of the most unique and varied natural landscapes found in North America. From emerald-green national forests to the incredible red rock formations jutting up from the earth at Garden of the Gods, you’ll find it nearly impossible to resist taking the time out of delivering loads to explore the natural beauty this state has to offer. Don't miss out on a viewpoint in Ouray, the Switzerland of America, which gives you a beautiful view of this Victorian-era mining town! The state is especially famous for its Rocky Mountains, however, much of the eastern part of the region is dominated by a unique grassland that  extends across the American continent. The Great Plains is an area that stretches more than eighteen hundred miles from north to south of North America and more than five hundred miles from east to west. Offering views of mountains, valleys and gorges, the Million Dollar Highway is a road like no other. Stretching for around 25 miles (40 km) on the U.S. Highway 550, it has been said that it's one of the nation’s most spectacular drives. The highway delivers jaw-dropping vistas and stunning backdrops on its winding and often dangerous road. So why is this stretch of road named the Million Dollar Highway? There are several stories including that it cost a million dollars a mile to build it and that its fill dirt contains a million dollars in gold ore. Speaking about gold, the state is known for its gold mine located near Colorado Springs where you can haul important mining equipment and waste rock to and from the mining site. Colorado is also home to a variety of bottling plants, each producing and distributing an assortment of different beverages which drivers can deliver to locations across the States. Being a state that promotes its natural beauty, Colorado is always looking at ways of using clean energy to protect the environment. With unique parts and equipment always on the move from the number one wind turbine factory in the USA to wind farms across the States, we hope you will be a of this industry. Nearly half of the state's 66 million acres are dedicated just to farms and ranches. Play a key role in contributing to this important economy and exporting the state's produce across the States. From hay bales to farming equipment, truckers will be the backbone of making sure this important and large industry in keeps on ! One of the largest contributors to the local economy is Denver International Airport. Drivers can expect to see lots of details around the airport including Denver's famous horse statue. Truckers can also deliver to and from a fan-favorite cargo drop off point, located in the inside of a large cargo aircraft. Nicknamed the Mile High City, Denver features accurate representations of famous landmarks and industries for drivers to discover and deliver cargo to. Denver will also feature a realistic road network, including the famous \"mousetrap intersection\", the interchange of I-25 and I-70, which is best known for its spaghetti-like design. Located at the foot of Pikes Peak, you'll find the city of Colorado Springs, the state's 2nd most populous city. Colorado Springs is known for its many one-of-a-kind attractions, the most iconic being the city's Garden of the Gods Park, a National Natural Landmark. Featuring 300 million years worth of geological history and incredible towering red sandstone rock formations, it is no wonder it is ranked top of the list of best parks to visit in the US.

All you need are supplies, oxygen, decades of training, experience with sandstorms, and a can-do attitude to discover the purpose of those weird black cubes that appeared out of nowhere. With a bit of sprucing up, this place is going to be awesome! is a sci-fi city builder all about colonizing Mars and surviving the process. Choose a space agency for resources and financial support before determining a location for your colony. Build domes and infrastructure, research new possibilities and utilize drones to unlock more elaborate ways to shape and expand your settlement. Cultivate your own food, mine minerals or just relax by the bar after a hard day’s work. Most important of all, though, is keeping your colonists alive. Not an easy task on a strange new planet. There will be challenges to overcome. Execute your strategy and improve your colony’s chances of survival while unlocking the mysteries of this alien world. Are you ready? Mars is waiting for you. Building on a planet not fit for human life challenges you to build a smart, functional colony. Bad planning isn’t about traffic jams, it’s about survival of your colonists. You really don’t want rolling blackouts in a city constructed in a place without oxygen. Each colonist is a unique individual with problems and strengths that influence the needs and behavior of the other colonists. Things can get really interesting if your chief scientists develops alcoholism after one too many long nights in the lab. Retro-futuristic super structures housing colonists, factories and commercial buildings with their own “neighborhood personality.” Create colonies that value science over everything else, while tired workers drink their pay away at a local bar, or attempt a utopia among the stars. Inspired by the classic sci-fi of Asimov and Clarke, Surviving Mars holds many secrets. During each playthrough players may encounter one of Mars’ individually crafted mysteries. Uncovering these secrets might bring your colony great fortune, or terrible ruin. What is that sphere that manifested itself outside colony HUB B, and is it friendly? Combine static and random research through experimentation, which allows for a different experience for each journey through the game. Attain new scientific breakthroughs by exploring the uncharted terrain of Mars's surface. A sleek, modern take on the bright futurism of the 1960s. A time of exploration and adventure.

Xenohuman factions include hardy pig-people, poison-drinking waster pirates, unforgiving neanderthal hunters, and more. Factions feel different from each other - how you handle a group of frenzied fire-breathers will be different from stopping the wolf escorts sent by fur-bodied riflemen. Some xenohuman cultures are friendly, while others are hostile or prefer to be left alone. Sanguophages pass among humans undetected while concealing superhuman powers and working to satiate their genetic need for blood. Powered by superintelligent nano-machines, sanguophages are ageless, immortal, preternaturally beautiful, and capable of launching deadly spines and healing allies. You may join their cult if deemed worthy, or force them to grant you immortality. Make your colonist into a mechanitor - a person with a brain implant that lets them psychically command semi-living machines called mechanoids. Create mechanoids by growing them inside high-tech gestator tanks and command a wide variety of new combat and labor mechanoids. Build a mechanoid army and experiment with a variety of battle tactics using swarms of cheap, disposable gunners, tanky defenders, shield-projecting snipers, flame-spitters, and more. At home, make mechanoid workers that can manufacture goods, rescue and tend to colonists, build and repair structures, sow and harvest crops, haul stuff, and other tasks. Grow your swarm and upgrade your mechanitor into an unstoppable mechlord. Call down three new super-mechanoid bosses to fight. Defeat these super-deadly enemies and their escorts and harvest special mechanoid chips from their smoking husks to advance your mechanoid technology. Your mechanoid infrastructure produces toxic wastepacks. Left unfrozen, waste deteriorates and leaks pollutants into the environment. Pollution poisons your colonists, mutates plants and animals, blocks the sunlight, and attracts giant hostile insects. Manage your waste, or embrace pollution with new gear, detoxifier organs, and genetic modifications.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "Ludeon Studios", "publisher": "Ludeon Studios", "game_tag": ["Indie", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Colony Sim", "Singleplayer", "Moddable", "Psychological Horror", "Sci-fi"], "dev_names": ["Ludeon Studios"], "minimum_requirements": "", "recommended_requirements": ""}

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environmental conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants and research facilities to complete this mission. Your presence on this planet will not go unnoticed. As you build up your industry and disrupt the natural order, the world will start seeing you as a threat. Build up your defenses. Construct walls, barriers and defense towers as the attacks get stronger with every passing day. You will face thousands of hostile creatures trying to eliminate your presence. Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using rift technology. Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You’re the only human there, after all. Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game – including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. The Riftbreaker™’s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience.

With different personalities and talents, you can recruit bloodthirsty warriors, dexterous hunters, and ingenious craftsmen. . . and even a drunk lazy alcoholic! ● Powerful AI and command support allows you to set up and manage the work flow of clan members with a high degree of freedom: farming, harvesting, assembly line production, base patrol, automatic repair and even maintenance...everything can be automated and customized by you. ● Need a light?

It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldn’t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.

Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors. Become the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature. Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise. The Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. However, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge. The Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline. We realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include: All that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. -", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "Afterthought LLC", "publisher": "Afterthought LLC", "game_tag": ["Dinosaurs", "Survival", "Open World", "Multiplayer", "Simulation", "Hunting", "Realistic", "Massively Multiplayer", "Adventure", "Early Access", "Action", "Third Person", "Horror", "Co-op", "Sandbox", "Walking Simulator", "Team-Based", "Strategy", "RPG", "Indie"], "dev_names": ["Afterthought LLC"], "minimum_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system Windows 7 64-bit or later (64 Bit ONLY) Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 3.0 GHz or faster. 8 GB RAM NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 or AMD Radeon R9 280X series card or higher.

Travel the world, meet interesting wizards, and find out what's wrong with them. Each of your team has their own personal struggles, and between missions you can choose how much to dig into them, overcome them, and guide these oddballs to become friends.

You can read more about anything you're fuzzy on, arrange them in a way that makes sense to you, and keep a visual overview of what's going on.

And if there isn’t, we’ll give you the tools to make your dream a reality. While not required to join in on the fun, VRChat was built to take advantage of VR headsets in many unique ways. That means avatars that flow with your movement, and systems that work alongside various hardware platforms to provide full-body tracking, finger tracking, and much, much more. There’s something magical around every corner. Come take a look, and see what you find. In VRChat, there’s always something to do – and people to meet there. Visit a planetarium and have a chat about astronomy. Go on a virtual hike through a majestic fantasy forest. Pull up to a car meet, and talk shop with some gearheads.

Wyoming designated the American bison as the official state mammal in 1985, and to this day you can still find large herds of them grazing across the prairies and protected land which is designated for the conservation of wild bison since their decline across the US. Located in the west of Wyoming, the Bridger-Teton National Forest, best known for the four W's - Wildlife, Waterfalls, Wilderness, and Wild and Scenic Rivers, is the largest intact ecosystem in the lower 48 United States and a must-visit location for any traveler. Devils Tower is a famous butte with hundreds of vertical cracks and a total height of 5,112 ft (1,558 m), which makes it an extremely distinctive feature in the area full of prairies. This natural wonder is much better experienced by seeing the \"bigger\" picture with everything around; therefore the closest possible point will be the visitor’s center and in front of the gate at the entrance to the park. But do not weep, because there will be a nearby farm and an interactive viewpoint below the tower, in which the most attentive may find something very interesting. The agriculture industry is one of the state's largest contributors to the local economy. While crops, fruits, and vegetables make up a large percentage of this industry, the production of beef is the largest part of Wyoming's agriculture sector. Many of the cattle are usually sold and exported around the world from Livestock auction houses, which will be one of the new industries arriving to Wyoming. Another form of logistics that is prominent across the state is the railroad. Contribute to the maintenance of the locomotives that serve the railways as you deliver important rail parts to and from the rail supply depot, as well as delivering and picking up cargo from the freight trains that arrive daily. Chemical plants and quarries will also be other locations where drivers can pick up and deliver various parts and materials from. These loading points are always located on the edge of the refinery or quarry to keep drivers safely away from the active mining areas. Legend says that a certain trucker (we’re all feeling proud here right?) decided one day to take a picture while driving on Interstate 80, as he was approaching an area near Fort Bridger known as \"The Three Sisters\". The image made it seem as if the road over the crest was never-ending and ever since then, people commonly referred to this area as the \"Highway to Heaven\". Time to get back to earth now and mention numerous new road signs which will include speed limit signs, freeway and highway signs, tourist signs, and dynamic message gantries! Speaking of road gantries there’s also a very interesting new visual - gantries with traffic lights at crossroads. These are not exactly a common occurrence, that is why you should always be prepared to take a picture just so you can take it with you \"spiritually\" wherever you go. You will also be able to cross several colorful bridges, and if open space is not for you, be sure not to miss the I-80’s Twin Tunnel near Rock Springs. So, get behind the wheel and discover Wyoming!", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "SCS Software", "publisher": "SCS Software", "game_tag": ["Simulation", "Indie", "Driving", "Open World"], "dev_names": ["SCS Software"], "minimum_requirements": "Windows 7 64-bit Dual core CPU 2.4 GHz 4 GB RAM GeForce GTS 450-class (Intel HD 4000) 200 MB available space Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) Dual core CPU 2.4 GHz 4 GB RAM GeForce GTS 450-class (Intel HD 4000) 200 MB available space Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit Dual core CPU 2.4 GHz 4 GB RAM GeForce GTS 450-class (Intel HD 4000) 200 MB available space", "recommended_requirements": "Windows 7/8.1/10 64-bit Quad core CPU 3.0 GHz 6 GB RAM GeForce GTX 760-class (2 GB) 200 MB available space Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) Quad core CPU 3.0 GHz 6 GB RAM GeForce GTX 760-class (Intel HD 5300) 200 MB available space Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit Quad core CPU 3.0 GHz 6 GB RAM GeForce GTX 760-class (2 GB) 200 MB available space"}

You will build the airport’s infrastructure with everything from runways and taxiways, gates and aprons to constructing terminals with check-in, security, restaurants and shops. You will manage the business perspective of the airport by hiring employees and executives, making deals with airline companies and making sure that ends meet by keeping an eye on budget and resources. You will have to cater to the passengers by keeping waiting time to a minimum, by having friendly and helpful staff around and by making passengers feel secure, keeping any potential incidents at bay; a happy passenger is a spending passenger. Hopefully you won’t run into any problems such as stressed out employee, equipment breakdowns or bad weather which can cause massive delays or even emergency landings. You will be held accountable when things go wrong and filthy rich when things go right. Your objective is to build and manage your airport to perfection by making strategic decisions, designing the optimal airport layout and ultimately making sure that your passengers and airlines are satisfied. You will need to build the entire airport from scratch including terminal foundations with floors, walls, doors and items as well as the airport infrastructure including runways, taxiways, aprons and other airport infrastructure. Everything in Airport CEO is deeply simulated and it is your job to make sure it all runs smoothly and with a positive bank account. Airlines and their travelers are an essential element of Airport CEO as they consist of the main source of your airport’s income. Signing contracts with airlines bring cash-flow and passengers to your airport which in term means opportunities for receiving different service fees, as well as passenger expenditures. Airlines come in different sizes and have different requirements on your airport and the services you offer, you are responsible for not only planning the flight schedule but also for meeting and maintaining the needs. Occasionally you will need to handle emergencies and delays due to bad weather or accidents in the area, all which will put your management skills to the test. Passengers in Airport CEO all have their unique personalities, needs, a background story and most importantly; a flight to catch (on time). Passengers are thoroughly simulated and their decisions, behaviors and opinions about your airport are affected by several factors. Passengers in Airport CEO, just as in real life, must wait in lines, check in, pass security and then entertain themselves until their flight is ready for boarding. Arriving passengers must find their way the baggage claim, get a hold of their bags and maybe pass a customs booth before getting on their airport transfer. Whether they’ll be able to actually catch their flight is up to you: Passengers might have a hard time finding their way around the airport so you build an information desk, passengers might get irritated because of the long security queue and waiting time so you extend its capacity, passengers might complain about the lack of fun things to do in the gate area so you build a duty-free shop or exclusive brand boutiques. Employees are those you rely on to keep your airport running. Just as passengers they are simulated individuals who have a mind of their own. Employees have a number of different roles and it is your job to make sure that your airport has the right and necessary work force at any time. From passenger service agents, janitors, ramp agents and mechanics, security officers to administrators and executives. The more you expand your airport’s capacity and services, the more versatile and skilled your employees have to be. When employees interact with passengers, they’ll have to be skilled at managing people and stress resistant in order to avoid making mistakes or give bad customer service. Airports are complex mega-structures with a lot of different buildings and facilities. While a small airport might not need more than a simple grass runway and a terminal, as you grow your airport you will have to expand its facilities ranging from air control towers, larger aircraft stands and taxiways to fire, weather, catering or fuel stations. As your airport grows your terminal grows with it and you will have to make sure that it is equipped with the necessary facilities that passengers are expecting. Building a terminal in Airport CEO is highly customizable where you lay out its shape and interior such floor type, walls, windows and doors. Baggage needs to be processed and transported to the same flight as its owner and its all up to you to avoid bottlenecks and by designing the ultimate airport terminal. Data, data, data! As the acting CEO of your airport you need to be able to make difficult business decisions based on current operation. In Airport CEO you’re provided with multiple sources of information from which you can draw conclusions and manage your airport. As the CEO you will not only be responsible for the architecture of the airport but also for those working in it. Tired of planning every flight? Establish an informatics department and let an automated system do it for you! Tired of assessing the monthly budget balance? Hire a CFO which can help you cut cost and set prices.

Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food.

Each player commands his own squad of AI-controlled soldiers in battle. If you lose a soldier, you can immediately switch to another in your squad and continue the fight. Thanks to this, battles in Enlisted feel truly massive and intense, similar to the real battlefields of the Second World War! The battles will take you to all corners of the world!

Choose just one or all of them and build your own army to your liking from the myriad of squads with different specialties. Based on your choices, you’ll end up on different battlefields, each with its own weapons, vehicles and matching uniforms. Not just infantry, but also 350 of the most famous and diverse military equipment is at your disposal: tanks, armored cars, motorcycles and aircraft, both fighters and bombers, are available for your army.

Craft your unique battle machines from dozens of interchangeable parts and destroy your enemies in explosive PvP online battles! In 2027 a mysterious viral epidemic known as the ‘Crossout’ swept the planet, countries and populations simultaneously began to fall at an alarming rate all over the Earth. Those who did not die in the first few days, were plagued by hallucinations and headaches, many people went mad, others and committed suicide. The source of the disease could not be detected but the cities that were once the vibrant social and economic beacons of humanity were left ravaged and deserted. Survivors gradually began to change — after fifteen years of transformation, the changes became visible. The most noticeable metamorphosis occurred in the eyes of the affected — some began to glow, while others resembled black holes. To hide their unnatural looks and conceal the mutation, people started wearing padded clothing and sunglasses. Twenty years have passed after ‘Crossout’. Humans still remember their life before the disaster. As always, there are groups trying to recover the old world, while others enjoy the chaos and destruction.

Assetto Corsa Competizione will feature Blancpain GT Series’ 2018 and 2019 seasons. Assetto Corsa Competizione is born from KUNOS Simulazioni's long-term experience, and it takes full advantage of Unreal Engine 4 to ensure photorealistic weather conditions and graphics, night races, motion capture animations, reaching a new standard in terms of driving realism and immersion, thanks to its further improved tyre and aerodynamic models. Designed to innovate, Assetto Corsa Competizione will be set to promote eSports, bringing players at the heart of the GT World Challenge and putting them behind the wheel of Ferraris, Lamborghinis, McLarens and many other prestigious GT racing cars, all reproduced with outstanding level of detail. Assetto Corsa Competizione is designed to faithfully recreate the performance and the driving experience of real GT World Challenge cars through a sophisticated mathematical model that accurately replicates tyre grip, aerodynamic impact, engine parameters, suspensions and electronics systems that determine vehicle balance, as well as the influence of mechanical damage on the car's drivability. Unreal Engine 4 guarantees photorealistic rendering and an accurate representation of scenarios, car materials and weather conditions. Thanks to the multi-channel audio sampling of real GT cars, the game conveys captivating and immersive acoustic surroundings and realistic environmental effects. Even the secondary details are faithfully reproduced to make you feel the thrill of being in the cockpit of a real racing car. Doors, windshield wipers, headlights, racing lights, racing equipment and control devices such as ABS, traction control, engine ignition and ECU mapping, are all under the driver’s management to assure the best performance and offer the player total control of the car.

Encouraged by the success of the Blancpain Endurance Series, which after its creation in 2011 quickly became the global reference for GT racing, world-renowned Swiss watch manufacturer Blancpain and the SRO Motorsports Group decided at the end of 2013 to extend their partnership to the Blancpain Sprint Series. From 2015, teams and drivers were also given the opportunity to compete for an overall Blancpain GT Series title. Varied grids were the result, with a host of respected GT teams and drivers at the start of each race. The Blancpain GT Series also saw an influx of young and talented drivers, making it a worldwide benchmark in GT3 racing.

With nothing but a few thousand dollars, you will have the opportunity to build and develop your own factory, designing every aspect of its operation. Start by constructing buildings and organizing the first production line. Hire employees and train them to ensure their skill levels are high. Plan the optimal production process and start making money. You will need it to develop technology and research each of the sixty car models available in the game. Carefully build your brand’s reputation and become a master of promotion and sales, where popularity plays a key role. Always stay one step ahead of the competition. The beginning of the 20th century brought new opportunities. Demonstrate the qualities of an excellent leader as you become the head of the car factory. Choose one of the seven available cities. The future of the automotive industry is in your hands. Discover the capabilities of the production line that revolutionized automotive history by reducing production costs and speeding up car assembly. Start with individual stations, then group them together and divide tasks accordingly. Learn how to optimize the entire process and ensure a regular supply of parts. And yes, there are robots available. Who knows, maybe in the future you will become a completely independent plant that produces even the smallest screw. The Research department is essential in the factory for discovering new car projects. Currently, the game features nearly 60 different vehicles. Discovering each new project will require increasing amounts of experience and time. Acquire new technologies to build advanced devices that support and accelerate the work of scientists. Behind every car you create are people, with varying levels of experience. It is your responsibility to ensure the factory operates at full capacity. Manage and train your employees, assigning tasks according to their skills. Keep them satisfied and well-rested to ensure efficient work. However, remember that well-trained employees demand higher wages. Each vehicle has its life cycle, during which popularity rises and customers are willing to spend more. Learn when to run promotions, lower the price, or discontinue the production of a particular model. Overall trends and the brand quality of the manufactured cars influence popularity. Take care of it, as it directly impacts sales and the success of the factory. Experiment with game mechanics. Some of them require multiple attempts to work optimally. Your factory can be a highly complex system, but simply observing it can be a very relaxing experience. As you gain experience, you can take on various challenges and test your skills in short missions. Some are tricky and require creativity to earn a large number of stars.

From their orbital station, prospectors drop to the planet surface to explore, harvest, craft and hunt while seeking their fortune. From toxic atmosphere to savage wildlife, apex predators to destructive storms and forest fires, Icarus is a planet with a temper. Preparation and planning are everything, whether it’s to find a source of oxygen, stalk your next meal or stockpile supplies for a long journey into the wilderness. Go at it alone, invite up to 8 Steam friends to join your game or play on dedicated servers. The First Cohort of prospectors has been granted initial mining licenses for over 64 square kilometers of hand-crafted terrain, full of hidden caves and biomes to explore. Every single tree is harvestable, every rock can be voxel mined, every creature can be hunted. Tame and ride mounts, craft advanced tech to extract resources faster and prepare yourself for harsher challenges. Unlock four tiers of technology from hand-crafted to advanced composites and electronics, plus 7 different building materials. Choose from over 100 talents as you specialize your character in exploring, building, farming, hunting, taming, fighting and more. Return to the orbital workshop to exchange exotic matter for advanced tech and items with unique properties, which may give you an advantage on your next drop. However you want to experience Icarus, you can. Forge your claim in Open World, battling the elements and apex predators for survival and testing the limits of your survival instincts. Accept timed Missions to mine exotics and earn Ren as you complete tasks for the power brokers overseeing the planet. Drop down to the planet with nothing, establish a base from scratch and escape in time. Let your creative mind run wild in the Outpost regions with regenerating resources and safe environments. Icarus was once destined to be a second Earth, but when terraforming collapsed - the air turned toxic and humanity’s hopes of colonizing a new world died. Icarus became a joke, a symbol of humanity reaching for the stars and failing. The xeno-engineers salvaged what they could, released modified embryos and halted the terraforming process. Yet when they discovered the cause of the failure - exotic matter - new interest was ignited. Valuable beyond reckoning, these ‘exotics’ sparked a gold rush and fueled political tensions back on Earth. Prospectors flocked to Icarus to complete contracts to extract exotics and conduct research for various factions. Those that survive return to orbit as seasoned veterans, converting their exotics into advanced technology, and taking on ever more challenging drops.

Defend Your Legacy. Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is a full remake of the groundbreaking non-linear RPG Romancing SaGa 2, which originally launched in Japan in 1993. Embark on an adventure featuring both new and classic SaGa franchise features, complete with Japanese and English voiceovers, original and rearranged compositions, and much more! This is an ideal entry point for new players and provides an amped-up experience for longtime fans. The Seven Heroes were once hailed as saviors, but the ancients feared their power and banished them to another dimension. It was foretold that they would return to save the world once more... Thousands of years have passed, and the heroes have become legend. Furious that humankind has forgotten their many sacrifices, they have now returned as villains bent on revenge. As legions of monsters swarm the world, take on the role of Ruler of the Empire of Varennes. Defend your legacy across successive generations, expand your realm and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one! Join forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics. Choose the next Emperor from this wide pool of candidates, each eligible to inherit the throne and become the next protagonist. The knowledge and abilities of previous rulers are passed down to the next through the mystical art of inheritance magic, forging a lasting bond between you and your chosen characters. The game presents a unique story structure that offers a vast array of narrative experiences in response to your choices and which objectives you tackle first—from how you expand the Empire to what order you challenge the Seven Heroes. Your actions and decisions will dramatically alter the course of the Emperor's journey. The strategic turn-based battle system of the original has been further enhanced to a timeline system. Enjoy all the classic SaGa mechanics like \"Glimmers,\" where you learn new abilities whilst in the heat of battle, and \"Formations,\" which provide unique benefits to the retinue based on composition. Furthermore, the remake welcomes the new \"United Attack\" feature to perform combination attacks with your retinue members to turn the tide of battle! The 2D pixel sprites of the original game are now modeled in full 3D while retaining their charming, familiar appearances based on the beautiful concept illustrations by Tomomi Kobayashi. All towns and dungeons are now also fully rendered with reworked terrains and layouts. Select from one of three difficulty levels to match your preferred playstyle, from Casual, Normal, to Hard (Classic). Casual offers a story-focused experience with less emphasis on battle, while Normal is recommended for veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game. Hard (Classic) is perfect for players looking for the brutal but satisfying challenge of the original 1993 version. Kenji Ito, the composer for the original Romancing SaGa 2, returns with a vengeance to present a beautiful soundtrack full of new arrangements! The music can be toggled between the original and new versions from the Options screen.

Deep simulation mechanics capture the unique challenges of surviving the harsh winters and carving a thriving settlement out of the northern forest. Lead your goblins to greatness! We're Korppi Games, a three-person games company in southern Finland. We're lifelong gamers who want to make deep, thoughtful video games. In Goblin Camp, you're in charge of a little encampment of goblins. If you manage your settlement successfully, it can grow from a collection of shacks and lean-tos into a bustling city of stone and brick. You'll harness lots of different resources to build your camp, but the most important tool at your disposal will be your growing population of goblins. Each of them has their own combination of skills, traits and personality quirks, and as they do things and have experiences, they'll learn new skills and develop new abilities. To make managing all this as easy as possible, you can easily access all the information you need about your camp at a glance in our manager interfaces. They'll show you exactly what tools and materials you have, how much food you're producing, and alert you to any trouble. Goblin Camp takes place on procedurally generated maps, where we simulate the effects of glaciation and the kind of geography that emerges in its wake. Because each map is different, every game will be too. The forest in Goblin Camp is more than just the trees. The game simulates how the forest grows after the glaciers recede, and it keeps on growing and evolving throughout the game. As your settlement grows, the decisions you make will have an impact on the woods around it, and eventually the whole map. Of course, nature isn't just there for your convenience. You'll have to help your goblins survive the harsh winters and the extreme weather. Our advanced water simulation is there to create both opportunities for water engineering and the occasional spring flood, but look out for strong winds blowing fires toward your camp! Goblin Camp is set in a world that draws inspiration from the fantasy classics we know and love, and from ancient Finnic mythology. These ancient beliefs and ways of life, almost completely forgotten even in Finland, give a unique twist to the Goblin Camp experience. You'll have to deal with the spirits of the forest: tapping their energies to power your own magic, and defending your goblins from their menaces. They're not the only trouble, either: your camp may be menaced by various beasts, humans and monsters, even elves - especially if you've been raiding their settlements! In Goblin Camp, you can unlock new advances through magic or technology - or both. Travel to the spirit world in search of the secrets of the old magic, or develop industrial machinery through engineering. Either way will open new possibilities to grow your settlement and remake the world in your image. Your task is to guide your goblins on their way to greatness. The decisions you make, large or small, will have a real impact on your settlement and the broader game world. As your camp grows, the game grows around it as well. Gameplay in Goblin Camp will scale up as your settlement gets bigger: you can stay involved in the little details if you like, but the interface will free you to concentrate on the big picture. All in all, Goblin Camp delivers a rich settlement-building experience in a multi-faceted, living fantasy world. As you face the unique challenges of surviving the harsh boreal winters and carving a thriving settlement out of the primeval woods, your choices determine what kind of civilization will emerge in the frozen north.", "review_summary": "4 user reviews", "developer": "Korppi Games Ltd", "publisher": "Korppi Games Ltd", "game_tag": ["Early Access", "Simulation", "City Builder", "Colony Sim", "Fantasy", "Building", "Agriculture", "Management", "Crafting", "Combat", "Nature", "Survival", "Strategy", "Base Building", "PvE", "3D", "Lore-Rich", "Procedural Generation", "Colorful", "Stylized"], "dev_names": ["Korppi Games Ltd"], "minimum_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system Windows 10 Core i5-4670 4 GB RAM NVIDIA GeForce GTX 850M Version 11 2 GB available space", "recommended_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system Windows 11 AMD Ryzen 5 5500 16 GB RAM NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Version 12 2 GB available space"}

Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique “movies,” guiding your survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies. Each \"movie\" is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives. New technology dubbed \"the AI Director\" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie. \"The Sacrifice” is  the new add-on for Left 4 Dead. \"The Sacrifice\" is the prequel to \"The Passing,\" and takes place from the L4D Survivors' perspective as they make their way South. In addition to advancing the story, \"The Sacrifice\" introduces a new style finale featuring \"Sacrificial Gameplay\" where players get to decide who will give their life so the others may live.

Experience a realistic simulator game of being a Tank Mechanic. Find abandoned and destroyed tanks from battlefields of Second World War. Use special tools to find each tank, and extract it from the ground. Grow your repair service business and start your own tank museum. Start the engine of a newly renovated tank, and feel its former power! Use tools and take each tank apart. You can disassemble tank exterior parts, from the bottom (wheels and tracks) up to the turret (gun, barrel, gun cradle etc.). Additionally, the interior of the tank is also available to be renovated, the crew space, tank engine and tank drive system. Take a seat inside the tank, as any of its crew. From here you can have better and easier access to the interior parts of the tank. Repair hatches, viewers, ammo holders, drive control components and gearbox parts. To start the tank, you need to repair its engine, gearbox and fuel system. Take the engine out and move it to a special engine stand, to be able to interact with it. Make sure the fuel, coolant and oil systems are assembled and the fluids are filled, so the tank engine can be put to test. Our tanks and vehicles are based on construction documents, expert opinions and insights from top II World War museums. Our goal is to give a fun and realistic simulation experience of building and repairing these legendary machines. Customize the tank as you wish, use different camouflages, paint colors, decals etc. One of the ways to obtain a tank is to get it during the extraction mission. After finding the spot where the tank is underground, call for the excavation team. Prepare the tank for extraction, by pumping the mud out of the tank and then cleaning the tank from whatever's left. Finally, order the lifting of the tank onto the truck trailer, to finish the mission, and move the tank into the workshop. Go on the training ground, check how your tank is dealing with special obstacles. Get inside the tank, start the engine and drive around to see if everything is working correctly. You can also take the tank to the proving grounds, where you are able to shoot the tank’s armament on a special shooting range. You can use two different camera modes for better control of the tank.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "DeGenerals S.A.", "publisher": "DeGenerals S.A.", "game_tag": ["Tanks", "Simulation", "World War II", "Realistic", "Singleplayer", "First-Person", "Building", "Relaxing", "Action", "Indie", "Management", "Walking Simulator", "Crafting", "Economy", "Casual", "Exploration", "Resource Management", "Adventure", "Atmospheric", "Family Friendly"], "dev_names": ["DeGenerals S.A."], "minimum_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system Windows 7 (64-bit) or newer Intel Core i3 2100 / AMD Phenom II X4 955 BE 8 GB RAM GeForce GTX 570 / Radeon HD 6970 Version 11 8 GB available space macOS 10.13.6 or later Intel Core i3 2100 / AMD Phenom II X4 955 BE 8 GB RAM Nvidia GeForce GTX 570 8 GB available space", "recommended_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system Windows 8.1 (64-bit) or newer Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 1600 16 GB RAM 4 GB VRAM  (GeForce GTX 980 / AMD Radeon R9 Fury) or better Version 11 12 GB available space macOS 10.13.6 or later Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 1600 16 GB RAM 4 GB VRAM  (GeForce GTX 980 / AMD Radeon R9 Fury) or better 12 GB available space"}

Wage-slave scrapper life isn’t enough anymore, and at last you’ve pulled together the funds (plus a hefty loan) to have a go at independence. Based in the same universe as Blue Bottle Game’s last hit NEO Scavenger, learn to manage your dysfunctional crew and ship as you fend off bankruptcy...or worse. Every choice you make will affect the outcome of the game. In character creation, you’ll use a Career Kiosk to shape your character’s background, income, and qualifications. Use it to customise your traits and skillset, which will be essential when managing your ship, its crew, and anyone sticking their noses in your business. You’ll start out the game with enemies, ex-lovers, and acquaintances to seek out… or avoid. Just remember your early decisions will affect your options and outcomes in conversations down the line. Build your dream ship from the ground up, using detailed, functional parts. Scavenge “pre-loved” parts in the boneyard to upgrade your ship - finding old or rare parts in the system is much cheaper than tracking down the original manufacturer. Who has time to scour the solar system? Hook up subsystems, add extra power and fuel, and be sure to replace parts which have worn out during your adventures. Parts are essential to your experience and will change how your ship feels to fly. “I cannot change the laws of physics, Captain!” In Ostranauts you will be piloting a ship under the laws of Newtonian flight, learning to fly using in-world manuals and sheets. It will be your job to manipulate control panels, flip switches, and to resist the urge to press the big shiny red button… Every craft has a different flight feel based on thrusters, hull mass, and how you’ve customised the ship. Remember to use a light touch whilst docking, and try not find yourself in the outer rim with an empty fuel gauge. Even in the darkest corners of space, you are not alone. Each character you encounter runs an AI that is constantly making choices based on their current needs and past experiences. They have physiological and emotional needs, ranging from basic wants like food, oxygen and water all the way up to deeper needs like intimacy and security. As captain, keep an eye out at the space port, scout out a crew and build those relationships. Your background will shape out how you are able to interact with other characters and if they will join your ship - have you developed a silver tongue or does fear rule your ship? Based in the same universe as NEO Scavenger, Ostranauts will be rich with lore for those who wish to explore. After the collapse of civilization on Earth, colonies and factions formed - colonising other planets, moons and asteroids - with only those able to adapt to the harshness of space able to survive. As states and corporations spread their reach through the System, whispers of unexplained phenomena are creeping through back channels. Blue Bottle Games encourages players to join the discord, share modding ideas, and to help grow the world of Ostranauts. Modders who want to make their experience more unique are able to edit a wide variety of game data - most of the game's data is in plain-text files for easy access.

From simply approaching levels with different combinations of dives, slides, and kicks, to a fully-fledged level editor allowing players to create action in any way they see fit.  Further, use the sandbox menu to replay levels with different combinations of weapons or add more enemies to up the challenge. And with full workshop and mod support, experiment with hundreds of custom levels and weapons to spice up the action! Getting the best experience out of MAXIMUM Action requires a bit of creativity and imagination from the player, and I understand not everyone is up to the challenge! But if you’ve always wanted to play a role in your own balls to the wall action movie then I’d say give a try! -George Mandell", "review_summary": "Mostly Positive", "developer": "George Mandell", "publisher": "George Mandell", "game_tag": ["Action", "Gore", "FPS", "Violent", "Retro", "Indie", "Bullet Time", "Shooter", "Fast-Paced", "First-Person", "Old School", "Early Access", "Singleplayer", "Physics", "Blood", "Level Editor", "1980s", "Sandbox", "Stylized", "1990's"], "dev_names": ["George Mandell"], "minimum_requirements": "Windows 7 Or Later 2.4GHZ Dual Core Processor Or Higher 4 GB RAM GeForce 9800GT Or Equivalent Version 9.0 1 GB available space", "recommended_requirements": "Windows 10 3.0 GHZ Quad Core Processor Or Higher 8 GB RAM Geforce GTX 460 Or Equivalent Version 11 1 GB available space"}

The Sea God has riled up the oceans, and everyone aboard ends up shipwrecked on the island of Grimt! Luckily, the people of Grimt are kind and willing to point the now-penniless merchant to the island's main attraction, the Dungeon. Legend says that the golden land of Eldorante, filled with infinite wealth, sleeps at the bottom of the Dungeon, but the last time anyone ever reached it was before the city of Grimt was founded. Of course, that doesn't mean nobody else is trying... Makane soon runs into the prince of a foreign empire who seeks to claim the golden land and its treasures for his homeland. It's an action-packed race to reach Eldorante! Eldorante is a roguelite game with many Dungeon sections to explore. You can fight enemies in turn-based RPG combat, or avoid them to keep your level low and get better clear rewards when you beat the boss of the section you're delving into. Whether you get defeated or defeat the boss, leaving the Dungeon sets your level back to 1, but you get to keep everything you've found along the way. Power up with new equipment, extract skills as gems to equip, cook and eat meals, and recruit numerous partners to choose from for a leg up on subsequent delves! And if you feel like helping out the residents of Grimt, you'll find a cast of kooky characters who want all sorts of items. Delve the Dungeon, gathering loot and allies as you progress to aid you in your challenge as you start every foray at level 1. Strategize who to bring and how to use your skills to claim victory in turn-based RPG battles. You can fight enemies to gain levels during your Dungeon delves, but you can get better loot by beating bosses at lower levels. Will you challenge yourself? You can visit the pasture to plant crops that will grow as in-game time progresses, then use those crops to make food to give yourself an edge in combat.

Now there are only a few thousand humans left alive that must struggle to survive under the threat of the infection. Billions of infected roam around the world in massive swarms seeking the last living human colonies. Lead the campaign under the orders of Quintus Crane, ruler of the New Empire, and reconquer the lands devastated by the infected. In this mode, a random world is generated with its own events, weather, geography, and infected population. You must build a successful colony that must survive for a specific period of time against the swarms of infected. It is a fast and ultra addictive game mode. We plan to release a challenge of the week where all players must play the same random map. The best scores will be published in a leaderboard. This is a real-time strategy game, but don’t get too nervous. In Pause Mode, you can place structures to build, give orders to your army, or consult all of the game’s information. This game is all about strategy, not player performance or the player’s skill to memorize and quickly execute dozens of key commands. Pause the game and take all the time you need! Build dwellings and acquire food for the colonists. They will come to live and work for the colony. Collect resources from the environment using various building structures. Upgrade buildings to make them more efficient. Expand the energy distribution of the colony by placing Tesla Towers and build mills and power plants to feed the energy to your buildings. Build walls, gates, towers, and structures to watch the surroundings. Don’t let the infected take over the colony! What kind of people would want to combat the infected? Only the maddest ones. Train and contract mercenaries to protect the colony. They demand their money and food, and you will have to listen to their awful comments, but these tormented heroes will be your best weapon to destroy the infected. Every unit is unique and has their own skills and personality – discover them! Yes! They are billions! The world is full of infected creatures… they roam, smell, and listen. Every one of them has their own AI. Make noise and they will come – kill some of them to access an oil deposit and hundred of them will come to investigate. We have created our custom engine to handle hordes of thousands of the infected, up to 20,000 units in real time. Do you think your colony is safe? Wait for the swarms of thousands of infected that are roaming the world. Sometimes your colony is in their path! If just one of the infected breaks into a building, all the colonies and workers inside will become infected. The infected workers will then run rabid to infect more buildings. Infections must be eradicated from the beginning, otherwise, it will grow exponentially becoming impossible to contain. Prepare to enjoy these ultra high definition graphics.

With deliberate, calculated and unforgiving gameplay, GROUND BRANCH aims to be the true rebirth of the tactical realism genre of the late '90s and early 2000s. Powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 4, GB puts the \"tactical\" back in \"tactical shooter\"—no compromises. GROUND BRANCH's unique True First-Person System improves world immersion and awareness of your surroundings, providing zero disconnect between your view and your character's physical presence in the environment. See your foot sticking out of cover? Better tuck it in—enemies may be able to see it (and shoot it) too, but only if their line of sight and muzzle are verifiably unobstructed. Cameras are placed at the character's eyes and bullets originate from the weapon's muzzle. In GROUND BRANCH, what you see is what you get. Say goodbye to pre-defined kits and fully customize your character and gear from basic appearance and outfit to in-depth vest and weapon platform customization, down to individual pouch and attachment placement. What you bring to your mission is determined only by your loadout choice, with realistic consequences: With the upcoming encumbrance and stamina system, too much equipment will impact your character's speed and performance; place a scope too forward on the rail and your sight picture will be too small; bring a long rifle into CQB and weapon collision may prove a hindrance. Whether in 8-player co-op or 8v8 adversarial game modes, GROUND BRANCH's unforgiving gameplay makes careful and calculated teamwork essential. Gather your teammates and practice in full-featured training areas, including shooting ranges with dynamic targets and customizable killhouses.

Pick one of the beaver factions and see how long your colony can last. Control one of two beaver factions: the nature-friendly Folktails or the industrious Iron Teeth. Each faction has a unique style, buildings, and gameplay traits. Choose what fits your playstyle! Prepare your settlement for recurring droughts and waves of toxic waste. Stockpile on food and keep fields and forests alive even after rivers dry up. Rely on both natural water sources and artificial irrigation to keep the land arable and your beavers safe. Beavers of the future have millennia of experience in water engineering. Put up dams and floodgates, dig canals with explosives, and reshape the terrain to your liking. Use your wit to deal with the noxious badwater and bring life back to the wasteland. Turn timber into sophisticated machinery – from water wheels and sawmills to engines and mechanized pumps. Wood is the core resource in Timberborn, but the most advanced structures require metal. To find it, send your scavengers to the ruins of the old world. Supercharge your colony with mechanized beavers. Power them up, maintain them, and you'll get extra efficient workers for almost any job. They operate 24/7, and you can send them to the most hazardous areas. Create a thriving beaver settlement using a vertical architecture system. Space is limited, so stack lodges and workshops on top of each other, construct platforms and bridges, and set up a power grid for your growing population. Build a multi-district city with efficient production chains and nighttime activities. Follow the lives of individually simulated inhabitants throughout their day and celebrate when the next generation is born! An evolved beaver's lifestyle is not just \"work, sleep and chomp on wood\". Satisfy the needs of your rodents with a balanced diet, decorations, monuments, and more – on top of keeping the colony alive. Play on one of the included maps or create your own and share it with the community! With hills of different heights, ruins scattered in the desert, and all life depending on access to water, each map poses a different challenge.

The cracking process of the case is very similar to the real police case. The cases in the system all happened in Chicheng and are stored as key clues. Each clue contains different and essential information about the case. You need to constantly find new clues by looking at the information and fragmenting the clues. The content pieced together the completed case in your mind and reasoned out the course of the case. As long as you answer the correct questions about the case in the system, you can crack the case. After cracking the case, you can view the criminal’s “criminal statement”. Clues are interconnected. To move the case forward, it is necessary to find the information needed to discover another clue from one lead. In the process of cracking the case, you sometimes need to perform special operations on some clues, such as inferring the motives of the characters to complete the \"search warrant\" for the clues of the characters and inferring a reasonable time to \"invoke the monitoring\" to check and reason out. After the correct password of the encryption clue is \"decoded\", the encrypted content can be viewed, and so on. The more user-friendly design is that you can ask the system for help when you have no clue. The system will give you a certain range of tips, but a certain amount of investigative points will be deducted. After you have solved all the cases, Chicheng police will give your final evaluation based on the detection points and your performance. This is a text-only game with no motion pictures.

Once you’ve selected and taken on your livestock, regular feeding and watering will keep them healthy. Successful breeding and careful rearing of the young will help boost the numbers in your herds and flocks — and the more produce you have to sell, the more income you’ll receive for all that hard work. Expand your ranch enterprise by farming crops, producing sausages and cheese and even training and selling horses. There’s a large open-world environment outside your cosy homestead and it’s teeming with wildlife. So when you feel like slowing the pace, why not grab your trusty rifle and head out into the forest to stalk deer and hunt bears? But remember, the wilderness lives by its own laws and you aren’t the only skilled hunter in the neighbourhood. Sometimes your steady hand and sharp eyes will also be needed back on the ranch to stop hungry wolves turning your off-grid dream into a nightmare.

With a little help from your uncle, you get an apartment and your first job. But then it's up to you to achieve success and take over New York City any way you like. Slowly build multiple small businesses, grow them into huge corporations, or carve your own unique path – the possibilities are limitless in this vast business sandbox. You've never played anything like this! Go from a small apartment and public transport to luxury suites, fast cars and designer furniture. Put your money into investment funds and real estate. Succeed, fail, rebuild. But remember to take care of yourself, sleep and stay happy on your rise to the top. Do you have what it takes to build your own empire? Go from nothing to the most prominent tycoon in New York. Start a business, work smart, make it thrive and enjoy your life. How do you want to be successful? How far can you push it? How long can you make it last? Start your own gift shop, supermarket, coffee shop, law firm, clothing store, liquor store, florist, and more. You decide what success is - whether it’s a single shop, a chain of fast-food restaurants, a huge corporation, or making millions developing websites. Take out a loan, rent a building, design the logo, renovate the store, get stock, manage your money, hire staff, and build your infrastructure. Soon, you may have to start importing products from the harbour and distributing them through a network of warehouses. A bigger business means managers. Hire HR Managers, Logistics Managers, and Purchasing Agents. They all need desks and computers, so you’ll need a fancy headquarters. Need a delivery truck? Travel to a dealer and buy one. Need food? Go to a supermarket, but make sure you have a refrigerator at home. Big Ambitions is a life sim where your character has to physically interact with the world to survive and succeed.

Buy a big SUV, a speedy sports car, or the new luxurious Mersaidi S500. Maybe risk it all at the casinos or put your money into investment funds and reap the rewards. As you progress, you always need to ensure you get enough sleep and stay healthy and happy. Enjoy the journey, for as you grow older, you’ll discover that money can’t buy you time... or can it?

It draws inspiration heavily from F.E.A.R. in terms of action set pieces, while mixing exploration elements from Half-Life, along with some more modern features. The story takes place during a violent invasion on Selaco, a massive space station that's home to the surviving refugees after the fall of Earth. You play as Dawn, an ACE Security Captain who, with her recent promotion and high level security clearances, is digging deep into the truth behind Selaco's murky history. Before she can finish her investigation, Selaco is rocked by explosions and armed invaders. While Selaco may take place in a large-scale conflict, much of it will be the personal story of Dawn, the center-piece of the game. Selaco is a story-driven experience, and we don't say that lightly. A dedicated writer has been brought on board to assist with creating an engaging and believable sci-fi story and world. Turn the entire world into confetti with the destructive power of your weapons. Every single bullet will react properly with any materials or objects you hit. Our artists have created many different variations for each (voxel)object to ensure that the aftermath of each encounter is palpable. That once lavish office space now nothing but a pile of rubble with broken paintings, smashed tables, screen, chairs, smoke, and chunks of debris. With our FEAR influence, writing proper AI was a goal from the get go. The enemy is fully aware of each other's presence and work together to take you down. They will keep their distance if you apply constant pressure on them, will rush you if you hide or run out of bullets, toss grenades if you use the same cover for too long, and much more. Hundreds of custom lines have been written and acted out, providing hints to the player about their current plans and tactics. Selaco is accompanied by a full length original soundtrack composed by an experienced musician who has worked on many games in the past. To help immerse players in the story and atmosphere of Selaco, professional voice actors have been brought on board. Dawn will be voiced by the incredibly talented Melissa Medina, with other casting choices revealed at a later date. Completing levels allows you to replay that level in Incursion Mode, an expanded version of that map where your skills will be tested against a near endless onslaught of enemies. Win incursion maps to gain bonuses to aid you throughout the campaign. New exclusive Incursion Levels and new mutators will also be unlocked as the campaign progresses. Mod it till it breaks!

Build, harvest, and take resources from an environment where your every action affects the world around you. An imminent meteor strike threatens global destruction. Can you save the world without destroying it in the process? Construct buildings and towns, tend to your farm, hunt wildlife, build infrastructure and transportation, craft clothing, build power plants, and research new technologies. Specialize in a craft and trade your goods to other players. Develop your civilization and sculpt your planet. As your civilization grows, you’ll need to analyze data from the simulation; evaluating the impact you have on your world. Use this data as evidence in proposed laws, restricting harmful activities without disrupting the advancement of technology. Balance your individual needs with the needs of community, all while maintaining the state of the ecosystem. The future of your world is in your hands. Every organism in Eco exists as part of a detailed simulation; a disruption in one species can have cascading effects across the planet. Chop down all the trees, and habitats for creatures will be destroyed. Pollute the rivers with mining waste, and your farms will become poisoned and die. The ecosystem supplies the resources you and your community will need to stop the meteor. Manage your pollution, mining waste, hunting, and resource collection to balance your effect on this system. Eco is built on a rich ecological simulation. All the data generated from the interaction of plants, animals, climate, and players can be searched and analyzed using in-game graphs and heat-maps. Use the collected information as scientific evidence support to proposed laws. The ability to successfully debate using scientific evidence is your greatest weapon against the destruction of your world. Establish and maintain your own set of laws and government, which are enforced automatically by the game. Draft a proposal to limit clear-cutting in a protected forest, incentivize green energy solutions over fossil fuels by providing tax subsidies and penalties. Participate in elections for world leadership, allowing you to set tax rates and allocate community money. Use a programmable law system to make dynamic and flexible rules for the community, passing them by vote.  Construct a wide variety of governments; from tightly-regulated dictator-states, to tax-and-spend subsidy programs, or even lawless communities relying on trust. Your skills increase based on your food and shelter. By consuming a highly nutritious variety of food and building an elaborate home you will rapidly increase your skill points. Skill points can be spent on skills like farming, hunting, trade, engineering, research, and more. Contribute to the greater good while increasing your own personal success. In the player-run economy, you achieve the most when you specialize and trade both goods and services. Create stores to buy and sell goods you need asynchronously with other players. Setup contracts within the game’s quest-like labor market, soliciting other players to perform specialized work for you in exchange for payment. Build complex crafting machines and charge a fee for players to use them. A thriving economy in Eco can be both a powerful tool for progress, or a dangerous threat to the environment. To grease the wheels of commerce, you can create your own currencies, backed by fiat or by resources. Manage the value of your currency relative to others by setting exchange rates at asynchronous currency exchanges. Sell items at stores and collect credit from other players. Eco is designed for rich asynchronous play, allowing many players of many disciplines to contribute to one another’s goals at separate or simultaneous times. All of the world’s resources originate from its environment, which is affected by your actions. While a meteor looms over head — set to strike the planet in thirty days — a more subtle threat grows from player-interaction with the environment. Without careful attention, ecological destruction can destroy civilization before the meteor even strikes. To ultimately succeed, you and your community will need to use the tools of government and economy to find a balance between progress and protection. Eco is our forever project. We plan to keep growing, expanding, and improving it with the support of the community.

Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth? Do anything and everything. Caves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world. — Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point. — Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things. — Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few. — Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend. — Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent. — Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience. — Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to. Caves of Qud has one of the most expressive character creators of all time. Play the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a true kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes — the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon. Build your character out of: Play one of four modes: — Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts. — Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements. — Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures. — One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive? The game is nearly complete, and there are already hundreds of hours worth of gameplay here. But before 1.0, we’ll also be adding: Caves of Qud is a project of epic proportions that's been in development for over fifteen years, since 2007. It began as the science fantasy roguelike dream of co-creators Jason Grinblat and Brian Bucklew, who released the first beta in 2010. Since then, it's accrued a few more contributors who have enriched the project by helping to add visual effects, sound effects, an original soundtrack, a new UI, new game systems, new lore, and half a world of content. Caves of Qud has grown into a wild garden of emergent narrative, where a handwritten story weaves a path through rich physical, social, and historical simulations. The result is a hybrid handcrafted and procedurally-generated world that's alive in a way few games are.", "review_summary": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "developer": "Freehold Games", "publisher": "Freehold Games", "game_tag": ["Choices Matter", "Singleplayer", "Indie", "Early Access", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Survival", "Moddable", "Strategy", "Atmospheric", "Tactical", "Roguelike", "CRPG", "Difficult", "Pixel Graphics", "Turn-Based Strategy", "Character Customization", "Story Rich", "Traditional Roguelike", "RPG"], "dev_names": ["Freehold Games"], "minimum_requirements": "", "recommended_requirements": ""}

House Party's unique AI and scripting system allows the game to shape and mold its content around your choices.  You'll see something new or different each time you play.  To date, there are hundreds of different stories, side-quests, and narratives, and thousands of branching stories and dynamic elements.  Content is being added regularly, so it just keeps getting bigger and better!  Each new game starts at the door as a blank canvas for your decisions. Sweet news! Your buddy Derek invited you to a rager at Madison's house. Surrounded by a group of eccentric partygoers, you must navigate your way through the night - no matter how wild it gets! Step into a sandbox adventure party game where even your simplest choices can impact the game in a magnificent way. Explore thousands of unique branching narratives with fifteen distinct NPCs that react based on your every remark and action, paving the way for tons of hours of unpredictable and hilarious entertainment. House Party’s gameplay starts with the conversations and grows with the decisions made along the way. With no true ending but dozens of stories to navigate, the night is what you make it. Explore a two-story house jam-packed with hundreds of items to discover, where every object has a purpose and some can be used in a variety of ways. Change the party's music with the mp3 player, invite a surprise guest over with the laptop, enjoy as many drinks as you can (without getting caught), and... well, we'll leave the most exciting surprises up to you to uncover. Show items to NPCs and they may react with varying dialogue or relationship fluctuations. Most of these hidden objects are vital for completing an NPC's personal storyline and winning their approval. Sometimes you don’t even need any items to cause a ruckus.  Play your cards right and maybe you can win them over with your charm alone. You don't have to thank us, but we invited fifteen of our craziest and funniest acquaintances! A new-to-town sorority girl willing to do crazy things to fit in, the most brahsome brah around, a wild mud-wrestling southern belle, a freakishly buff straight-edge dude hawk-eyeing all the booze, and many more hilarious and unique personalities await. Listen closely and the characters will chat about your actions, conversations, and choices, and also provide hints and insights into cracking their stories open. Throughout the night, you may overhear information about their backstories or catch them gossiping about other guests at the party. Every NPC has favorite bands, personal beliefs, friends and enemies, and party goals for the night. Fully-voiced by amazingly talented voice actors and actresses, the partygoers feel vibrant and alive from the moment you set foot through the door. With fifteen of the most interesting, reactive, and hysterical NPC partygoers to ever exist and a rapidly growing roster, there is always plenty of social variety around the house. All of them have inner motivations and strong personal opinions, making them fun to make various choices around and amusing to see interact with one another! As you navigate the party, your words and actions will dictate whether each NPC digs your vibe or is seconds away from knocking your lights out.  One bad decision might get you beaten to a pulp, while a good choice might result in making an ally that will have your back for the rest of the night. Every response you choose when speaking to an NPC changes how they feel about you. Keep an eye on your social gauges and watch your gameplay impact whether an NPC is crushing on you, feels so-so about you, sees you as a good friend, or hates your guts.  Relationship values, good or bad, may open new doors.  And, whether you're into guy love or girl love, it's possible to win most characters' hearts for steamy romantic fun at this party! NPCs will respond differently whether they like you, love you, or hate you, unlocking or blocking off potential party choices and unique interactions. They also see what you do and hear what you say, so be careful because one small choice can change everything. Ever heard of the Game Grumps? Make the right choices and you may find Dan and Arin landing unexpectedly in the middle of the house party! Explore their unique storyline, watch them hilariously navigate the festivities, and choose from one of the multiple paths to help them get back to their show! Looking for a hot Spanish tutor to hop in and shake things up? Your decisions could make Lety Does Stuff come knocking on the front door. Explore her wild and crazy side story if you want a real taste of adventure! As one of the only indie studios to ever integrate real-life celebrities into a video game, it has been a ton of fun connecting the guests to the story and welcoming the iconic humor and personalities of Dan, Arin, and Lety into the party. This fall, Doja Cat joins the cast in an expansive all-new optional DLC story!

Make use of glimmers and combos in battle; meet a diverse cast of races, including monsters, mechs, and vampires; and experience your very own story, created through your choices and actions. Travel to 17 unique worlds from the Junction, either led by the hand of destiny or by a path forged by your own choices. Discover the completely different cultures and landscapes, ranging from a densely developed forest of skyscrapers and a green and luscious habitat covered in plant life to a world governed by five witches, or one ruled by vampires - just to name a few of the distinct settings. Six leading characters, all from diverse backgrounds and with vastly different goals, set out on their journey in five unique story arcs. They venture to the myriad of worlds for their very own personal reasons: One, a human on a mission to protect the barrier defending his city; another, a witch trying to regain her lost magic while maintaining her disguise as a schoolgirl; and yet another, a vampire lord out to regain his crown and reclaim the throne as the rightful king of his world. Even selecting the same protagonist for a second--or third or fourth--playthrough will lead to completely new events and stories, a completely fresh path and experience. SaGa Emerald Beyond has the greatest number of branching plots of any game in the SaGa series. The story branches abundantly depending on your choices and actions. Every time you visit a world, the story will evolve, allowing the protagonist and player alike to discover new possibilities. As the story unfolds in this way it becomes a tale all of your own, not only affecting the path you walk but also the multiple potential endings that await each protagonist. SaGa Emerald Beyond further refines the highly strategic Timeline Battles the SaGa franchise has been long renowned for. With series mainstays such as the skill to spontaneously acquire abilities through the Glimmer system, tactical ally placement known as Formations, and United Attacks that enable individual skills to connect together to form devastating chain attacks, it offers the best iteration of SaGa's turn-based combat to date. The new combat system adds more drama than ever before, allowing you to support party members, interrupt enemy actions, and use United Attacks by strategically manipulating the order of ally actions.

Both the preparation and execution of the invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) had a large air component and involved many airfields in the UK and in France, especially after the Allies landed and built many Advanced Landing Grounds. Some German-built and occupied airfields were captured, repaired and re-used by the Allies as they advanced. Battle of Normandy will explore and recreate the drama as the Allies try to use airpower to secure the invasion beachhead and force a breakout to march to liberate France and attack Germany itself.

Granted the freedom to do whatever it takes to stop the Blacklist, Sam flies from exotic locales to U.S. cities as he races against the clock to find out who’s behind this devastating threat.

Have fun with your friends trying to complete each eerie paranormal mission, and help PAH Inc. capture the supernatural entities. You just signed on with PAH Inc. Paranormal Activity Helpers Incorporated, yeah sounds corny, but the pay is great. They said you won't ever be in any real danger, and they have tons of work right now. Your first job is at some old haunted house. There is a broker wanting to put the house for sale, but with everyone in the town spreading rumors of evil living inside the house, he needs some proof that it is safe. He actually seems creeped out himself. Anyway, he hired PAH Inc. to check the place out. You can go check it out alone if you'd like, but I would take at least 3 more friends with me. Check the place out, and if there is anything supernatural going on, try to bring evidence back to PAH Inc. This house was built over 100 years ago. The owners ran a funeral parlor. They held normal funeral services such as ceremonies, wakes, cremation and burying the dead. The rumor around town is that they also offered a very special service, a way to talk to your deceased loved one on last time. Several people paid for the service, and after some type of ritual, they were able to speak to the dead. Something apparently went wrong during one of the rituals. A person from town and the owners of the house disappeared and were never seen again. Over the last century, a few people that investigated the incident never returned. A few kids sneaking around the place claimed to hear laughter and see a little girl in the window. There probably isn't any truth to any of it. In Pacify, you will be running for your life around the narrow corridors of a dark, old house. There is a little girl that switches between good and evil roaming around. Different circumstances can cause her to change. Once the evil takes over, it will chase you and your friends all over the house. You must find a way to Pacify the evil and escape the house. As the game progresses, the evil gets smarter and faster. Play alone in single player mode, or play with up to 3 more friends in multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, you can choose to play with or against your friends. Read the notes for clues about Pacifying the girl. Find and use keys, dolls, wood and matches to help you on your way.

Chart a path to victory for your people by developing new advanced technologies and engineering projects and negotiating with the global community in the World Congress on critical issues. The choices you make in the game will influence the world ecosystem and could impact the future of the entire planet. Natural disasters like floods, storms, and volcanoes can pillage or destroy your Improvements and Districts – but they may also refresh and enrich the lands after they pass. In addition to these new systems, introduces eight new civilizations and nine new leaders. Seven new world wonders can be constructed, as well as a variety of new units, districts, buildings, and improvements. Volcanoes, storms (blizzards, sand storms, tornados, hurricanes), climate change, floods, and droughts. Strategic resources play an additional role in . These resources are now consumed in power plants to generate electricity for your cities. Initially you’ll be powering your most advanced buildings by burning carbon-based resources like Coal and Oil, but renewable energy sources also unlock as you progress to current-day technologies. Your choices about resource usage will directly affect the world’s temperature and can cause melting ice caps and rising sea levels. Shape the world around your empire to overcome unfavorable land conditions by making improvements like canals, dams, tunnels and railroads. When settling cities, consider the flood risk to coastal lowland areas, but keep in mind that in the late-game, new technologies like Flood Barriers can be used to protect these tiles. Make your voice heard among the other leaders of the world. Earn Diplomatic Favor through Alliances, influencing city-states, competing in World Games, and more. Use Diplomatic Favor to extract promises from other leaders, vote on Resolutions, call a Special Session to address an emergency, and increase the weight of your votes in your quest to achieve the new Diplomatic Victory. A new era has been added to the Technology and Civics trees. Combat new environmental effects with speculative ideas such as relocating your population out to seasteads and developing technologies to recapture carbon emissions. Nine new leaders from eight new civilizations are introduced. Each brings unique bonuses and gameplay, as well as a total of nine unique units, four unique buildings, three unique improvements, two unique districts and one unique governor. The Black Death ravaged Europe and western Asia in the mid-14th century, killing a greater share of the population than any other event in world history. The pandemic killed millions, ruined economies, upended political dynasties and transformed the face of the Western world. Your task is to lead your nation through the calamity: keep your population alive, your economy strong, and your faith unshaken amidst a world of terror and desperation. At the outset of WWI, the German Imperial Army had a daring plan: invade neutral Belgium and then rush the French heartland before they could mobilize to resist. If successful, the German forces would capture Paris within a month and end their resistance forever. In counter, the French command prepared Plan 17, an all-out onslaught designed to meet and stop a German offensive. When war was declared, both armies swung into motion and set up one of the most incredible and shocking military campaigns in world history. In this multiplayer scenario, players take the side of one of these two great powers at this same precipice. As Germany, your task is to capture Paris. As France, your task is to prevent its capture. The clock is ticking, and the enemy is moving. Advance!

No pressure, right? drops you into the heart of a darkly-comedic tale of televised chaos, where your every decision helps shape the fate of a nation. From ego-fueled celebrities to deceptive politicians and enigmatic advertisers - you control the public’s perception.  As long as you can hold the audience’s fickle attention, it’ll be your choice whether to toe the party line or hype up the scandal. Will you make that sportsman seem like a national treasure, or an alcoholic disgrace?  What about those scientists trapped in Dante’s Taint?  Or that new boss at multinational giant Rymmington-Svist who seems to live a double life?  Most importantly, will you help the brand-new government look benevolent, or is there something untoward about them that the public need to see? The power is in your hands to change everything, but you’ll have to decide quickly - the news goes out live! You are in the driving seat of a multi-level tale about both an entire country and a single family.  Being the architect of the nation’s future is a challenge, to be sure, but so is trying to hold your household together through the dark times.

After all, granny, there’s nothing more noble than unburdening your children! And then there’s your broadcast room - when it’s not overheating, it seems to be trying to electrocute you.  Keep the plates spinning as best you can, but remember, whether it’s a newsreader who just won’t take it any more, naked streakers at the Sportsboard Final, or the ever growing threat of nuclear war... this show MUST go on. Select your ads carefully to mould the public’s opinion.  Why not choose to show only adverts for the companies you have shares in?  Maybe that extra cash will help with the difficult decisions at home.  Or maybe you’ll be selling dangerous toys to the nation’s children… With more than 50 hilarious ads to choose from there’s never a dull moment - even during the breaks.

Created with help from more than 100 Marines and Soldiers who served in the Second Battle of Fallujah, this is urban combat as it's really fought. Stay tight! Teamwork is essential. AI enemies will stalk, flank, and ambush you, sneak through tunnels, lure you into traps, and use the same tactics against you that made the Second Battle of Fallujah among the bloodiest in half a century. In Six Days, every time you start a mission, entire buildings change shape inside and out, enemies take up new positions, and unique threats emerge. You’ll never know what to expect – just like actual combat. There are no “golden paths” here. Climb to rooftops, cross wooden planks, kick down doors, or climb through windows. The choices are yours. And so are the consequences. Early Access currently includes 7 all-human tactical co-op missions that can take place during both day and night and under a variety of weather conditions. Midway through 2024, we’ll also give you control of an AI fireteam. Then, we’ll add more missions, introduce civilians, and begin our single-player story campaign that draws from specific true stories, narrated by the Americans and Iraqis who were there.

Nothing prepared her for what happened that day. Did the Institute take away Miroita? Did the military, or the Federation itself? The distinction no longer seemed important. All must pay. Notari desperately fought on. Luciolla, the AI created by Miroita, was Notari's only companion. \"Miroita lives\" said her. Must see her. The thought is germinating, growing more powerful by day. It is a better reason to live each day to the fullest, knowing someone is out there, waiting to see her once more. Must not abandon her. Must not let her down. Fight on, to find one another again, one step at a time. She knows the day will come. And then, the other one showed up. But... Mirage Feathers is an anime themed pseudo-3D rail shooter. You are Notari, a cybernetic air-superiority fighter of the Federation's FEATHER program. You will experience fast tempo combat as you destroy enemy aircrafts wave after wave. Even though the whole world is against you, your ammo is infinite. So fight on, and prove your superiority! Notari's advanced fire control system automatically locks on a target when it passes your crosshair. Your attacks will then home in on the locked targets. As the story progresses, AI companion Luciolla will acquire weapons specs from stronger opponents, allowing Notari additional main weapon options. They all have different effects, and offer a range of playstyles. FEATHERs may unleash incredible power by initiating OVERDRIVE, enough to destroy everything in sight. Moreover, when in OVERDRIVE mode, your weapons system will have upgraded performance, all your attacks will be buffed. This game includes Story Mode and Endless Mode. Story Mode has scripted levels, and explores the characters outside battle with text-based dialogues and cute character art. Endless Mode gives you access to the full arsenal, and pits you against infinite waves of progressively more challenging enemies that spawn randomly. Is the game too hard? No problem, we have made um… Oh! Sorry, that's classified. One of the two FEATHERs from the Institute and best friend of Miroita. Outgoing, hot-tempered, fiercely independent. She is often frustrated by the reality that surrounds her, and is willing to act. She really likes to stick with Miroita. Most people always see the two together. Protagonist in the story, player character. One of the two FEATHERs in the Institute and best friend of Notari. Calm, obedient and reserved, she likes to err on the side of caution. Miroita often requires Notari's support to boost confidence, even though her abilities are Notari's match. Notari's companion originated from Miroita's own mind, but with a completely different personality. Her main strengths are intelligence gathering and planning. In combat she invades enemy systems to help Notari. She talks like a real person, and would not make you feel alone. Leader of the Institute, and the creator of both Notari and Miroita. Even though she was hard on the pair, she deeply cared for them. Notari thought otherwise, though.

You are a sleeper, a digitised human consciousness in an artificial body, owned by a corporation that wants you back. Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle. Inspired by Tabletop Roleplaying games, Citizen Sleeper uses Dice, Clocks and Drives  to create a player-led experience, where you choose your path in a rich and responsive world. Each cycle you use the dice you are dealt to choose what to do with your time. Make or break alliances, uncover truths and escape your hunters. Survive and ultimately thrive, one cycle at a time, and sometimes against the clock! The station plays host to characters from all walks of life, trying to eke out an existence among the stars. Salvagers, engineers, hackers, bartenders, street-food vendors, each has a history which brought them here. You choose which of them you wish to help, and together you will shape your future. Eventually, you will learn to use your dice to hack into the station’s cloud to access decades of digital data, uncover new areas and unlock secrets. This is your unique power, and with it you can change your future. Corporate secrets, rogue AIs and troves of lost data await those willing to dive into the depths of the station’s networks. Essen-Arp: to them you are just property, one more asset in a portfolio that stretches across the stars. You are the product of an abusive system, in a universe where humanity’s expansion is marked by exploitation and extraction. Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom. Citizen Sleeper uses Dice, Clocks and Drives to create a player-led experience, where you choose your path in a rich and responsive world. Each cycle you roll your dice. Assign them to vast range of actions available on the station. With every action, choose what, and who, matters to you, shaping the lives of those around you, and ultimately the future of the station. Clocks track both your actions and the actions of others across the station. From becoming a local at the Overlook Bar to protecting a friend from Yatagan enforcers, clocks allow you to track your own progress and the influence you have on the world around you. Follow drives not quests, allowing you to pick and choose the stories and activities that matter to you. As you do, you will shape your character's five skills (Engineer, Interface, Endure, Intuit and Engage), unlocking perks and bonuses that reflect and change how you choose to live in this world. Citizen Sleeper now includes all three post-launch DLC episodes FLUX, REFUGE and PURGE, which expand the game and introduce additional characters and locations to Erlin’s Eye in an exciting new late game storyline.

Choking out the land of both life and light, a new era of wondrous misery began. Centuries have passed. The once hallowed halls and bustling streets are mere shadows. Those deemed undesirable are thrown into the Great Well, a pit of chaos and disease. Cast into its depths for crimes unknown, you awaken in this moonlit subterranean world. Your only hope lies with the sleeping Old One deep below. But many perils lie between you and your ultimate goal. From the mind of horror master Akuma Kira, Lunacid harkens to a lost era of first-person ARPGs. Legendary for their meticulous design and dense dungeons, the King’s Field series was the Dark Souls before there was a Dark Souls. Long abandoned by AA/AAA developers, the mantle of “King’s-Like” is left to the humble indie. Which is great, because that's where all the cool weird stuff comes from anyways. The world of Lunacid is bursting at the seams with new things to discover, from hidden magics to secret areas. This isn’t just the odd room with a chest in it; entire new areas await those with a watchful eye. Esoteric puzzles and cryptic hints galore are sure to confound and delight even the experienced dungeon delver. Take yourself back to a time before dodge rolling. Swipe, backstep, block, and overcome foes with patience and persistence. Featuring a robust body targeting system and unique elemental weaknesses/resistances, each encounter becomes a skilful yet deadly dance of death. Begin your journey as a thief, knight, cleric, or… vampire? Building your character up to you. Over 75 weapons await you in the fetid halls of Lunacid. 37 Unique spells, each with applications beyond the obvious. Finding them all, however, is another matter. Unless you use a guide. Which hey, we won’t judge.┐(￣ヮ￣)┌ Don’t forget to save. Featuring dozens of hours of gameplay and multiple endings, Lunacid is a rich and rewarding take on a classic formula. Relics of past game design long abandoned lie in wait. So jump in the Great Well and let the wonders of Lunacid surprise you. Mimics might just steal your silver instead of eat you.

Day after day, she worked hard making a name for herself and attracting customers from all over Gensokyo. Then, on one fateful day, a certain customer paid her a visit. On that day, both her dream and her future were shattered. Having lost everything, she had to restart from scratch. And so, her life indebted to the tyrannical Yakumo family began... The young night sparrow will never give up. Besides, having being helped by Mystia, the powerful residents of Gensokyo will surely return the favor! A brand new izakaya simulation gameplay! You play as Mystia, the proud owner of a mobile izakaya. During the day, you collect ingredients all over Gensokyo, learn new recipes, collect or buy beverages... all in order to create the perfect dining experience. In other words, there is no battle and no danmaku in this game, only customers with varying demands that you need to fulfill! △You izakaya will be visited by different customers every night. They have different preferences, budget, and favourite dishes. Serve customers and remember their preferences, fill your cooking with music and love, and cook the perfect dish for each customer! Meanwhile, familiar characters from Gensokyomay visit as rare customers.Instead of ordering directly, they only give hints on what they want to eat.If you can satisfy them, they will give you special rewards using their unique “reward spell cards”! If you learn what each reward spell card does and string them into powerful combos, earning a hundred thousand yen a night isn’t a dream! △After satisfying Rumia’s preference, she will happily reward you with three meat ingredients △By satisfying rare customers consecutively, a combo reward is triggered! But what happens if you disappoint them? They will unleash their “punish spell cards” and punish you in the name of Gensokyo! △Serving dishes carelessly earns you a headbutt from sensei. 2.1 After the first appearance of each rare customer, Mystia will record information about them in her notebook, including their food and drink preferences, frequently appearing areas, and a funny little description. During daytime, she can communicate with them and enhance her bond with them. After reaching a certain bond level, they will provide Mystia with powerful support! Can you become best friends with your favorite characters? △Mystia’s handbook is full of useful information and secrets △As bond level increases, your customers become you friends and can provide you with many supports 2.2 While operating, Mystia will gain many companions, who can help with running the restaurant. They can serve dishes, serve beverages, or cook. With three companions, you can simply sit back and relax while they run the restaurant - though you still need to cater to the rare customers yourself. △Each companion can only perform one job. Set jobs for your companions before you open for business. △Kosuzu is busy cooking, Sakuya is serving beverages, and... Reisen! Stop goofing off! 2.3 By meeting and chatting with your friends, you can learn their stories, build stronger bonds. All your seemingly ordinary friends all have their own stories, and would only share them with you when they consider you a true friend. △Wriggle is already Mystia’s friend, so she speaks casually around her △With business at the shrine improving, Reimu’s brows finally loosened △The memory of Gensokyo, born for the sake of completing the Gensokyo Chronicle, Akyuu has never had a life of her own Each character has their own storyline.If you delve into them, you can learn their stories, whether happy or sad.

I hope you enjoy my attempts to experiment and evolve this game into something enjoyable and fresh. Bulwark also continues to evolve with each passing update, based on your feedback. So positive or negative comments are welcome. If it’s intended to help then it’s all appreciated, either here in the forums or in the friendly discord. You are in charge of the last remnants of free people on the Ursee, tasked with building a new home. Carve your path onto a world, tower by tower, wall by wall, sculpting from the daunting cliffs and perilous waters of an unforgiving landscape that refuses to be tamed. Design fantastic ocean fortress settlements. Progress is simple, grow the populations of various factions and you will progress on their Soultrees. Unlocking commanders and captains that may work for you, unlocking new ships, units and abilities. Bulwark - Explore the Great Ursee as you build your grand civilisation. Scavenge for resources,create trade routes and strike alliances with other factions scattered across the waves as you balance negotiation and conflict to grow your settlement. Freebuild - Enjoy a cosy ‘Freebuild Mode’, devoid of the conflict and challenges present in standard play, you can sketch and experiment without the need for resources, building without limits. Total Conquest  -  War has come to the Great Ursee. You start at war with every faction, diplomacy is disabled and the frequency and scale of raids is ramped up. It is no longer enough to just build - now you must survive. Wood, stone and Iron aren’t stored or tallied up, the only thing that counts is distance, not cost. You transport resources along your network of towers as well as trading routes over the sea. Towers and walls within range of the resource can be upgraded and built for free, those out of range cannot. The currency that powers diplomacy, army building, buying new locations and unique buildings is separate from resources, it runs on a currency called, Splinters. You gain these through population growth, trade with other factions or as rewards from combat. The game challenges you to design and grow grand fortresses, often at little cost other than setting up trade routes for resources. As you grow you may invite in populations from other factions which unlock faction unique content from their “soultree”.

Erik and his sister Mia live on a Viking longship, dreaming of the day they can explore the world in search of grand treasure. One night they encounter a pair of otherworldly creatures, Porcus and Purrsula, and are whisked away to a mysterious place known as Draconia - a legendary land full of monsters to befriend and treasures just waiting to be discovered. The adventure Erik and Mia have always dreamed of is finally underway! DRAGON QUEST TREASURES is all about the thrill of adventure—and that means treasure hunting! The adventure takes place in Draconia, a land that's home to countless pieces of precious loot. Join Erik and Mia as they search for the legendary Dragonstones, picking up as much treasure as they can along the way! With the threat of rival treasure-hunting crews looming large, Erik and Mia form a gang of their own and snag a base of operations. Every piece of loot they acquire adds to the total value of their treasure vault. When this value hits a certain point, their gang will go up a rank, unlocking new treasure-hunting abilities and the option to add to the base's amenities. Treasure hunting gangs have been known to flock from far and wide in the hope of striking it rich. “Rival Gangs” will stop at nothing to get their hands on Erik and Mia’s treasure – from attacking out in the field to launching a raid on base. Draconia was formed from the bodies of two enormous Golden Dragons. Over the rocky eons their rocky remains have eroded away to leave six floating islands. Erik and Mia can scout five very different biomes in their hunt for treasure, from volcanic mountains and bone-dry deserts to frozen wastelands. Each island in inhabited by various types of monsters. Using the powers of the “Dragon Daggers”, Erik and Mia can recruit monsters to join their gang. Each monster has a special ability called a 'Forte', allowing them to soar through the air or dive into the ground to bypass obstacles enroute to the loot. By working together with their well-manner monster, Erik and Mia hunt for treasures buried across the lands of Draconia! *Please thoroughly review the product content and bonuses before purchasing, as this product has a “standard edition” and a “digital deluxe edition”.", "review_summary": "Mostly Positive", "developer": "Square Enix", "publisher": "Square Enix", "game_tag": ["Party-Based RPG", "Hidden Object", "Action RPG", "JRPG", "RPG", "Character Action Game", "Cute", "Action", "Relaxing", "Story Rich", "Casual", "Family Friendly", "Fantasy", "Loot", "Atmospheric", "Emotional", "Singleplayer", "Soundtrack", "Creature Collector", "Anime"], "dev_names": ["Square Enix", "TOSE CO., LTD."], "minimum_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system Windows® 10 / 11 64-bit AMD Ryzen™ 3 1200 / Intel® Core™ i5-3330 8 GB RAM AMD Radeon™ RX 460 / Intel® Arc™ A380 / NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 750 Version 12 8 GB available space 60 FPS @ 1280x720, Preset \"Low\", Systen RAM 16GB required when running on Intel Arc GPU", "recommended_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system Windows® 10 / 11 64-bit AMD Ryzen™ 3 1200 / Intel® Core™ i5-6500 8 GB RAM AMD Radeon™ RX 480 / Intel® Arc™ A750 / NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 970 Version 12 8 GB available space 60 FPS @ 1920x1080, Preset \"High\", Systen RAM 16GB required when running on Intel Arc GPU"}

Now get ready to face nature’s most challenging conditions during a rare hunting expedition to Medved-Taiga National Park. Inspired by the harsh, frozen landscape of Siberia, you’ll traverse the unforgiving tundra, enter into the drunken forests and venture out on the frozen bay. Here, the weather can turn at an instant, leaving you swept in whirling snow and surrounded by cracking ice. Despite its grim appearance, Medved-Taiga National Park is bustling with life. You will find prey like Musk Deer, Reindeer (also known as Caribou in North America) and Wild Boar. But larger species also roam. The majestic Moose travels these plains, as does the fierce Brown Bear. Perhaps most unique of all - hunters in this reserve will face the highly intelligent and ghost-like Lynx. The open world of Medved-Taiga National Park measures 25 square miles (64 square kilometers), the same impressive size as Hirschfelden and Layton Lake District. It features a brand new, exciting narrative with 32 missions, 50 side missions and countless unique sights to discover. You take the role of an expert survivalist and hunter contracted to assist Alena Khasavovna and her scientific expedition. In addition to being a highly-trained climatologist, Alena hails from a reindeer herding people native to the region, offering her a unique insight into its challenges. The expedition is off to a bad start, and it's up to you to gather your group, help the locals and make sure everyone gets through the expedition in one piece. But it won’t be easy. Not everyone – and everything – wants you to succeed. As with previous paid DLCs, players that don't own the content themselves can join a multiplayer game set in Medved-Taiga National Park at no cost, by finding a player that owns it and simply joining their game. Multiplayer games allow hunters to compete or cooperate - the latter should prove useful in this challenging reserve. Lastly, the ATVs (available as a separate DLC purchase) are of course fully functional here. Driving on ice is as fun as it is nerve-wracking. To celebrate the release of Medved-Taiga National Park DLC, all players of theHunter: Call of the Wild will receive a free new set of clothes (purchasable with in-game currency) to enjoy in any of the game’s hunting reserves. And available exclusively for players brave enough to take on Siberia, there may just be a variation of one of the game’s weapons waiting for you as you progress through the brand new storyline… Medved-Taiga National Park features a dramatic environment unlike anything you’ve seen (let alone hunted within). The permafrost engulfing this region has created a massive sinkhole and forced clusters of trees to grow shallow roots, making them tilt and form the characteristic Drunken Forest. Not even the rock formations remain untouched by the elements. The impressive Lena Pillars have been ground down and shaped by the elements for millennia, slowly carving their unique silhouettes.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "Expansive Worlds", "publisher": "Expansive Worlds", "game_tag": ["Simulation", "Adventure", "Sports", "Hunting", "Multiplayer", "Open World"], "dev_names": ["Expansive Worlds"], "minimum_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system 64bit OS - Windows 7 Intel i3-4170 4 GB RAM NVIDIA GTX 660 / ATI HD7870 - 1GB VRAM 60 GB available space", "recommended_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system 64bit OS - Windows 10 Intel i7 quad-core 8 GB RAM NVidia GTX 760 / R9 270x - 4GB VRAM 60 GB available space"}

Where once people scouted the natural trails of Silver Ridge Peaks in search of silver and gold, they now come seeking a different kind of trophy - to hunt their favourite animals. Whether you are tracking turkeys through the valley or lining up to shoot a mountain goat on a cliff above the cloudline, it's hard to resist taking in the grandeur of the Colorado wilderness. Silver Ridge Peaks prides itself in the range of animals available to visiting hunters. Whether you are stalking through the boundless grassy plains in pursuit of Pronghorn, keeping an eye out for stalking Mountain Lions or observing Rocky Mountain Elk traverse the dense forests, the reserve has something for every hunter. The ferocious Black Bear is a popular attraction, as are the Mule Deer, Plains Bison, Mountain Goat and Bighorn Sheep. But the real attraction is a little more feathery; hunters are known to flock to the reserve in search of Wild Turkeys. Boasting a dramatic landscape that can easily take your breath away, the reserve takes great pride in its more elusive spots that can make visitors feel like they’re stepping back in time. From the mine and ghost town’s reminders of the past, to the cloud-piercing Red Mountains, the reserve is packed with marvels. As you roam the deep canyon or gaze upon the high altitude lakes, you can’t help but get lost in its beauty. Through the use of contemporary bow-making techniques and flexible but sturdy materials, this Longbow is a stunning take on an ancient self bow, making it effective even for modern hunters. Compatible with the arrows used for the recurve bow as well as introducing two new types, the Alexander Longbow allows you to hunt animals of all sizes. A single stave of hickory and bowstring combine to form a silent but deadly weapon that epitomizes the resourcefulness of the peoples who used it to conquer prey. The longbow is available in three colour variations: Lacquered, Rough and Ash. Silver Ridge Peaks spans an impressive 25 square miles (64 square kilometers), and it is up to you to decide if you wish to explore the landscape at your own discretion, or pursue the story with 15 new narrative missions. The history of Silver Ridge Peaks is as rich in legends of human endeavour and adventure as it is in studies of brutal expansion and mankind’s greed. Miners risked their lives to travel great distances during Colorado’s silver boom. Much of the landscape was blasted into its current shape, with only one consideration: the pursuit of money. The consequences of such single-minded profiteering have finally arrived, landing at the feet of the reserve’s latest warden: Allan Bradley. As he attempts to fill the shoes of his ailing father, Allan must repair the reserve’s reputation following a toxic spill from a century-old mine, and show the world that Silver Ridge Peaks is stepping forward into the future. Along with fellow hunter Remi Warren, it’s your job to show that there’s nowhere better to hunt than in the shadows of the Rocky Mountains. Try out Silver Ride Peaks without owning it by simply joining a multiplayer session of another player who owns the reserve. You will have access to everything but the narrative missions.", "review_summary": "Mostly Positive", "developer": "Expansive Worlds", "publisher": "Expansive Worlds", "game_tag": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Adventure", "Hunting"], "dev_names": ["Expansive Worlds"], "minimum_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system 64bit OS - Windows 7 Intel i3-4170 4 GB RAM NVIDIA GTX 660 / ATI HD7870 - 1GB VRAM 60 GB available space", "recommended_requirements": "Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system 64bit OS - Windows 10 Intel i7 Quad Core 8 GB RAM NVidia GTX 760 / R9 270x - 4GB VRAM 60 GB available space"}

Whether hunting treasure in far-off lands or building realms of your own, it’s never been this good to be square! Play as a Knight, Gunslinger, Ice Sage, Dracolyte, Pirate-with-a-parrot, or any (or all!) of the other Classes in Trove while mastering abilities from deadly ninja techniques to deliciously deadly ice cream crushes. Upgrade your gear to tackle epic challenges and strut your stuff with killer looks. Every playthrough is unique!

Brave deadly minions, bosses, and traps to “liberate” powerful armor and weapons, or dip into smaller Lairs for single servings of danger perfect for solo fun.

Load up on special gear, costumes, decorations, recipes, crafting ingredients, flying carpets, sea-faring ships, and dragons of mighty renown.
